reddit,1l34cxo,"[OC] Top10 U23 bargain Centre Forwards to keep an eye on this Summer.. Left out players like Harder, Jackson, Ekitike, Sesko etc because obviously they won't be any cheap. Enjoy :)



**Troy Parrott (23, AZ Alkmaar)** 

Technically gifted and clever forward with promise demonstrated through loan transfers but marred by injuries and inconsistency. Best used in a supporting role playing off a central striker or as a second striker, where he can utilize clever movement and good vision. Must work on the end product and physicality to become established at the highest level. However, this was his breakout season as he netted 20 times and helped AZ massively. 

 

**Evann Guessand (23, OGC Nice)** 

A physical, dynamic forward who can play as a central striker or out wide, Guessand offers good hold-up play and sufficient link-up. Strong in transition and with good runs into space, he lacks composure in front of goal. He is an asset for the squad because of his versatility but needs a clear development path to enhance his decision-making. Still young with plenty of time to evolve, he registered 23 G/A this season. 

**Promise David (23, USG)** 

A tall and strong forward that is still raw technically and tactically, but shows flashes of brilliance when given room to run at people. If he can improve on his finishing and coolness under pressure, he can be a top player. Another gem discovered by USG’s amazing scouting network, completed 21 G/A in 31 games. 

**Franjo Ivanović (21, USG)**

 An agile, intelligent forward with great box awareness, Ivanović combines shrewd movement with good finishing technique. He thrives in confined spaces and has technical skills to tee up play between attack and midfield. Needs to develop more physicality and consistency against better-class sides. He had a great partnership with Promise David and registered 23 G/A 

 

**Arnaud Kalimuendo (23, Rennes)** 

A mobile center-forward with a knack of reading the game and finishing clinically, Kalimuendo has already demonstrated what he is capable of in Ligue 1. Not the most elegant player but very good diagonal runner, good presser, and can finish with both feet. Still developing his all-round game, but has the ingredients to become a proven top-level striker. 22 G/A this season. 

**Lucas Stassin (20, AS Saint Etienne)**

 Skilled Belgian CF with natural goal-scoring potential, particularly inside the box. Stassin has good positioning and maturity for his age, but lacks physicality however he’s still developing. Needs to bulk up and extend his game outside the penalty area to make the step up. He still had 22 G/A even if he plays for a side that got relegated so definitely the potential is there. 

**Matthis Abline (22, Nantes)**

 Technically skilled and creative forward, Abline likes cutting inside wide or half-spaces to play. His flair, agility, and ball mastery are assets, but he occasionally becomes too selfish with the ball or overthink things. Needs to improve his decision-making and defensive work to develop into a top-class attacker. 13 G/A for Nantes. 

**Ange-Yoan Bonny (21, Parma)**

 A hard-working, physical finisher with direct style and physical build, Bonny is ideally suited to closing down system and counter-attacks. He may be nightmare for defenders due to his strength and tenacity but is not quite polished in front of the goal. If he could get better at first touch and finishing, he could quite possibly make a stride into a top team. 

**Santiago Castro (20, Bologna)** 

A dynamic Argentine striker with plenty of energy, Castro has good off-ball movement, excellent pressing, and a solid work rate. Good technically and with sound game reading, he prefers to make chances through movement. Needs to get more experience in European football but could evolve into a completed modern striker. He registered 18 G/A this season 

 

**Rômulo (23, Göztepe)**

 An energetic Brazilian attacker capable of playing anywhere down the front, Rômulo offers an all-action blend of work rate, technical ability, and tactical acumen. Not a blistering pace, he compensates with guileful movement and intelligent pressing. Still a bit off the beaten path but has tools to become a steady cog in better leagues.

In the last few years, many clubs from low-ranked leagues have started to make a splash in European qualifying. However, one of the most eye-catching improvements came from Andorra last year. Despite the occasional famous upset pulled off by the national team (most famously the 1-0 win against Hungary in 2017), Andorran teams were barely on a higher level than those from San Marino just a few years ago. Now, the picture looks significantly different; market values of players signed by these clubs have skyrocketed, and they at least have a few players good enough for European competition proper.

One of Andorra's most dominant clubs in recent years, both in the domestic league and in Europe, has been **Inter Club d'Escaldes**. After winning their first three titles in a row from 2019-20 onward, they reclaimed top spot as the clear best team in the country this season. The first European group/league stage appearance by an Andorran club has never looked closer; can Inter make it happen?

**Club history**

Nowadays sporting a badge [very much inspired](https://i0.wp.com/interescaldes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/interescaldes.jpg?resize=980%2C980&ssl=1) by Internazionale, Inter d'Escaldes were founded in 1991 in the parish of Escaldes-Engordany, just east of the national capital Andorra la Vella. They competed in the first edition of the Primera Divisió (Andorran top flight) in 1995-96, finishing in seventh, and remained a mainstay of the league thereafter. The club saw some success around the turn of the millennium, but despite third-place finishes in 1999-00 and 2000-01 and a cup final in 2002, a trophy proved elusive. 

The subsequent decade was a difficult one for Inter d'Escaldes as they recorded mostly lower-table finishes, playing three times in the relegation playoffs as the second-to-last-placed team. With the club seemingly unable to improve its results, the first relegation in Inter's history seemed only a matter of time, and it finally arrived in 2014-15 after just four points and a -54 goal difference from 20 matches. As other clubs I'm covering here that have faced adversity, this proved to be a much-needed reset for Inter, resulting in shake-ups of the board of directors, more local involvement, a new crest, and more high-profile signings including former Andorran internationals. This approach paid dividends quickly, as a fifth-place finish in their first second division season was followed by promotion as champions, the club's first trophy.

As Inter returned to the top flight in 2017, the club continued to strengthen. Sergi Moreno becoming the first Inter player called up to the national team for the first time, and the following year, former Deportivo, Espanyol and Getafe player Alberto Lopo became arguably the highest-profile signing in Inter's history. Even the COVID pandemic could not stop Inter's progress, as in 2019/20 they won their first ever top-flight title with a record 52 points; striker Genís Soldevila was named top scorer with 16 goals and coach Adolfo Baines was named Andorran manager of the year. The consistency would continue with two further consecutive titles in 2020/21 and 2021/22.

**Recent seasons and European performance**

Inter's dominance of the domestic league came to an end in the 2022/23 season, as other clubs in the league began to strengthen their own squads. In a rule change that also may have leveled the playing field in the 8-team league, the previous structure of promotion (top 4) and relegation (bottom 4) groups was simply replaced by four matches against each of the other teams. Rivals Atlètic Club d'Escaldes pipped Inter to the title with 63 points from 28 matches to Inter's 61, while it was UE Santa Coloma who proved strongest in 2023/24 with 66 points, three ahead of Inter, improving their performance from the prior season by an impressive 24 points. The fact that they lost out on the title despite high-profile signings like former Barcelona youth player Martí Riverola and former Gimnàstic de Tarragona players Jean Luc and Viti Martínez was a clear indication of the growing strength of the Andorran top flight.

As evidenced by their two second-place finishes as well as respectable European performances, Inter were very much still in the title mix, and they made their quality count again this season, finishing as champions with 62 points—seven ahead of Atlètic. Earlier today, they made it a domestic double with a 1-0 win, again over Atlètic, in the Andorran domestic cup, the Copa Constitució.

Inter's most eye-catching transfer was ex-Osasuna mainstay Roberto Torres, but he left for third-tier Gimnàstic in the winter window after starting all nine matches prior. Bigger contributions were made by several shrewd signings with Spanish lower division experience as well as two Frenchmen, ex-Montpellier forwards Alexandre Llovet (who did actually play for the first team in Ligue 1) and Guillaume López. The two attacking players have been in scintillating form; López up front has continued his complete dominance over the league with 20 goals from 21 appearances, making him the league's top scorer for the fifth(!) consecutive season. Meanwhile, Llovet has slotted in seamlessly in the no. 10 role with nine goals, despite starting only half of his 18 matches.

The club's clear improvement in squad quality has begun to show in Europe as well, despite only having five seasons of European experience to date. In past seasons, despite the odd notable performance like a 2-0 away win against Teuta of Albania, a 1-1 home draw against CFR Cluj and a famous 2-1 home win against Hibernian, Inter were eliminated over two legs in every tie where they faced stronger opponents. However, it was only a matter of time before the dam broke, and it broke spectacularly in 2024-25. Both on paper and in the minds of most people following Inter's Conference League first qualifying round tie, Velež Mostar (who had upset AEK on penalties just a few years prior) were the superior side, yet they arrived in some turmoil. Manager Dean Klafurić, who many followers of the Bosnian league felt had given some stability to the club, surprisingly departed just prior to the game, and their disorganization showed in the first leg played in Mostar.

Inter were the better side in the first half and shocked the home fans by taking the lead in the 34th minute through Equatoguinean international Joan López Eló. While Velež improved as the match went on and grabbed a 65th minute equalizer through Brazilian winger Lohan, the game ended in a hard-fought draw, a quite unexpected result for Inter and a significant boost for them ahead of the second leg. Inter now felt they had a chance, but even the most passionate of the club's fans could hardly have predicted what would happen next in Andorra.

In an open-ended affair, Velež had the chance to take the lead after being awarded a penalty in the 39th minute, but experienced striker Nermin Haskić hit the post. Near the end of the half, Inter burst into life as two clinical finishes from Guillaume Lopez in the 44th minute and second minute of added time saw them take a shock 2-0 lead (3-1 on aggregate) at half-time. Velež regrouped and managed a goal back through Ante Oreč, but rather than boosting his side's hopes, it was Inter who found a second wind. Domi Berlanga proved just as deadly a finisher as Lopez, adding two goals of his own to the tally in the 57th and 84th minute before Sascha Andreu completed the demolition with a fifth goal in added time. The most impressive part of Inter's play was their technical quality, carving open Velež time and time again on the counter, and the 6-2 result on aggregate was no less than they deserved.

This set up a second qualifying round match against Greek giants AEK, who, rather than the expected revenge match against Velež, were probably surprised to find themselves facing a minnow from tiny Andorra instead. Indeed, the first leg in Athens went exactly as predicted, with AEK jumping to a 3-goal lead within thirty minutes through Robert Ljubičić, Levi Garcia and Mijat Gaćinović and adding a fourth in within ten minutes of the restart through Harold Moukoudi. However, the Greeks bore several gifts afterward, and there was nothing for Inter to beware: Domagoj Vida headed past his own keeper in the 65th minute, Garcia missed a 75th minute penalty, and a poor touch by Thomas Strakosha gifted the ball to Sascha Andreu, who was then brought down by the goalkeeper and coolly put away the spot-kick in the 78th minute. At 4-2, Inter started to believe again, and that belief would grow even stronger as an unbelievable strike by Viti Martínez brought the score to 4-3. Thus, rather than facing a demoralizing defeat, Inter walked away with an unbelievable away result against a far superior and more experienced opponent.

Unfortunately, there was to be no repeat of the Velež performance as AEK's superiority told in the second leg, where the team from Athens ran out 4-0 winners. However, such strong performances from a side many considered complete minnows before the qualifiers certainly raised eyebrows. With Inter winning the league by a clear margin, the removal of the preliminary round (which would have eliminated three of the four lowest-ranked teams by country coefficient), and a start in the Champions League instead of the Conference League, this is certainly the best chance the club have ever had to make a deeper run into UEFA competitions.

**How far can they go?**

One of the few available numerical measures that can help predict a team's strength in European qualifying is squad value; at 4.6 million Euros, Inter's should be enough to give them a shot at the Conference League groups, considering they start in the Champions League. With solid experience and depth across the squad as well as attackers Lopez, Llovet, 38-year-old Andreu and Rafinha (no, not that one, the other one, or the one spelled differently) in excellent form, the eye test also makes me believe they have all the raw materials to get there barring an extremely unlucky draw. If you're looking for a team from a true footballing minnow to follow in qualifying this year, Inter are arguably the ones to look out for. 

**Fun fact:** Inter have a partnership with Indian outfit Inter Kashi, which resulted in 23-year-old winger Harmanpreet Singh joining the club on loan (although, with his loan deal expiring at the end of the month, he is yet to play a game.) A fellow Inter Kashi player, Sachu Siby, was also supposed to join, but despite apparent confirmations of the signing by respected Indian football journalists, I have not found any record of the transfer actually taking place.

reddit,1kq4nhu,"Why the NBA WILL NEVER reduce the season from 82 games. Give me a reason why?. 
Reddit Post Body:
There’s always debate about reducing the NBA regular season—“make it 56 games,” “every game would matter more,” “less injuries,” etc. It sounds great. But it’s functionally impossible. Here’s why:

1. The CBA Makes It Nearly Impossible

The Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) ties league revenue directly to player salaries through Basketball Related Income (BRI). Players are guaranteed around 50% of all BRI. So unless team revenues drop, players still expect that full 50%.

Now here’s the math problem:
	•	NBA season = 82 games
	•	Proposal = 56 games (a 32% reduction in games)

2. Players Won’t Take a 32% Pay Cut

Let’s say a player makes $20 million over 82 games. That’s about $243,902 per game.
If we drop to 56 games, keeping the same per-game pay means the player still makes $13.66 million — a loss of $6.34 million.

Multiply that across the league and you’re talking about billions in lost player compensation. Not happening.

3. Teams & Owners Won’t Eat That Either

Teams generate revenue through tickets, concessions, sponsorships, and local TV contracts, all based on 82 games. Less games = less revenue unless prices go up.

4. Fans Won’t Pay More for Less

To keep revenue constant while cutting 26 games, ticket prices would need to increase by ~46%.
Here’s the math:
82 games of revenue ÷ 56 games = 1.464x per-game revenue required.
Are fans going to pay $146 for a seat that used to be $100?
Maybe in a few markets. But not league-wide.

5. Conclusion

The math, the CBA, and economic incentives don’t line up.
	•	Owners won’t pay players the same for fewer games.
	•	Players won’t take 30-40% pay cuts.
	•	Fans won’t pay 40-50% more per ticket.

reddit,1kksldu,"“The Rockets have previously held serious interest in the Suns’ Devin Booker, but team sources said that is no longer the case.”. Full quote:

“The Rockets have previously held serious interest in the Suns’ Devin Booker, but team sources said that is no longer the case. Not only do team officials still have faith in Jalen Green, who is five years younger than Booker and $66 million cheaper over the next three seasons, but also Booker’s struggles last season shifted the thinking on this front.”

Additional quotes regarding the Rockets interest (or lack thereof) in other potential trade targets:

“As for Williamson, who has spent the majority of his first six seasons falling short of expectations while experiencing health issues along the way, team sources said the Rockets see him as too risky.”

“While Durant is widely seen as the most attainable of that group, and he is known to be very interested in playing in Houston, team sources said the Rockets still have significant reservations about that possible partnership, in large part, because Durant’s age (36) would be so out of sync with their younger timeline. It’s worth noting that previous talks between the teams about Durant, team sources said, were initiated by the Suns.”

“That brings us to Antetokounmpo.

Of all the possibilities this summer might bring, the idea of the “Greek Freak” donning a Rockets jersey is seen as the most intriguing within the organization. The cost most certainly would be exorbitant, with a collection of draft picks, veterans to make the money work and a young talent or two likely to be part of the package. And because of how Antetokounmpo best operates, as a primary playmaker and a hub of the offense, the prospect of him playing alongside Alperen Şengün in the frontcourt — if he wasn’t dealt — would come with its challenges. But not only is Antetokounmpo widely considered one of the league’s top three players, but also he’s still young enough at 30 that the runway for a Rockets future would be long.”

reddit,1ki5e5c,"Russell Westbrook and Kemba Walker are launching an “AI-enabled funeral planning startup”. Link to article: https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2025/05/07/nbas-russell-westbrook-launches-ai-enabled-funeral-planning-startup-.html


Article text: 

National Basketball Association superstar Russell Westbrook is taking a shot off the court at simplifying funeral planning with artificial intelligence.

The famed Denver Nuggets point guard on Wednesday announced the launch of Eazewell, a startup that uses AI technology to streamline the process for coordinating funerals. Westbrook founded the venture with former Charlotte Hornets star Kemba Walker and childhood friend Donnell Beverly Jr., who serves as president of Russell Westbrook Enterprises and CEO and co-founder of Eazewell.


""My whole career, on and off the court, has been about stepping up decisively in the moments that matter most,"" Westbrook wrote in a statement to CNBC. Westbrook and the Nuggets are currently facing the Oklahoma City Thunder in the NBA Western Conference semifinals. ""Eazewell is exactly that — a decisive solution to a very real problem.""

The Los Angeles-based company uses AI to curate funeral options catered to each user's budgets and preferences. The platform assists with paperwork, budget planning, invitations and overlooked tasks such as canceling a deceased loved one's utility bills and social media accounts. Eazewell currently has 11 employees and has already tested its beta platform with more than 1,000 families. 

Eazewell has not disclosed funding but has revenue agreements with partner services. The startup is also working on partnerships with finance and life insurance companies in the space. The service is free to use and does not have an ads component ""at this stage,"" a company spokesperson said.

""We're trying to take the weight off people's shoulders as much as we can, and make this process so much easier for people,"" Walker told CNBC in a phone interview. Walker played college basketball with Beverly at the University of Connecticut.

Eazewell traces its origins to Westbrook and Beverly's high school days, when their friend and basketball teammate Khelcey Barrs III passed away unexpectedly from an enlarged heart. Westbrook commemorates Barrs to this day by wearing a bracelet with the initials ""KB3"" in every NBA game he plays and on his signature Jordan Why Not Zer0.6 ""Khelcey Barrs"" shoe.

""It's a reminder that life can change in an instant,"" Westbrook said. ""You don't get to choose the moment, but you do get to choose how you respond.""

The experience left a lasting effect on the two friends, Beverly said, but it wasn't until the death of Beverly's parents that he experienced funeral planning hurdles firsthand. Beverly said the experience was ""messy"" and ""grueling.""

Disillusioned and frustrated by the process after the death of his mother and father in 2016 and 2023, respectively, Beverly turned to his close friends to come up with the solution that became Eazewell.

""It just seems like the perfect time to really turn our shared pain into purpose,"" Beverly said.

One of Eazewell's most innovative features is its voice-activated AI agent that can gather cost quotes and call funeral homes on a user's behalf.

Recent advancements in AI have only recently made it possible to automate tasks and create agents that can manage these jobs in an empathetic and compassionate manner, said Viviane Ghaderi, Eazewell's tech chief and a former Amazon executive.

Stephen Stokols, an Eazewell investor and CEO of Tru Skye Ventures, an early-stage sports technology and wellness venture firm, said these ""transformational"" AI advancements helping bring the funeral industry out of the ""dark ages"" initially drew him to the project.

Walker said he hopes Eazewell can offer users the tools to navigate a topic that is not taught in school or early life.

""We know how important it is to have someone by your side to help with the details that come after a loss,"" Westbrook said.

reddit,1l5zvqv,"Defunct Team Spotlight-Oorang Indians. The 1920s NFL was a mix of unique teams and cities that were more like an extended family than a formal league. One of these teams-the Oorang Indians, a team that featured Hall of Famers Jim Thorpe and Joe Guyon, featured the first halftime show in NFL history and one player would wrestle Bears on occasion, and was sponsored by a dog kennel of all things.

All players on their rosters for the two seasons (1922 and 1923) were Native-American and most of them came from the famous Carlisle Indian School where Thorpe himself attended. LaRue, Ohio is the smallest town to ever have an NFL franchise only having a measly population of 795 in 1920. 

The Oorang Indians owner, Walter Lingo, was an Airedale dog breeder and was stated as saying that Native-Americans and Airedales had a supernatural bond. Thorpe defended Lingo after neighboring farmers were upset that Lingo had been raising ""sheep-killers"". Thorpe stated that he had seen an Airedale save a 6-year-old girl from a bull. After this endeavor, Thorpe and Lingo became friends and were known to hunt together.

In 1921, Lingo invited Thorpe and Pete Calac who had been teammates with Thorpe at Carlisle Indian School to a hunting trip. By the end of the trip, both Thorpe and Calac agreed to work for Lingo to advertise his Airedales. Lingo then purchased a franchise for the 1922 season. Lingo thought that having a franchise would open up doors for the sole purpose of selling his Airedales. Lingo created the team on the premise that it would be all-Native-American and that the team would help run his kennels when not at games or practicing. 

Lingo named the team the Oorang Indians after his kennels and favorite dog breed. Lingo had originally wanted the Indians to play their home games in LaRue, Ohio but due to the smallness of the town they were forced to play their home games in nearby Marion as it was the nearest town with a field suitable for football. The Indians were practically a travelling team for their two-year history as they only played one game in Marion during that time. This was good for advertising Lingo's kennels, but the players were frequently tired having to be on the road constantly.

Thorpe then travelled across the country to recruit Native-Americans for the new team. Most of the roster had very limited playing experience and some were close to the age of 40 when they joined. Much of the roster was not full-blooded Native-American but Thorpe made them prove that they had some ancestry in order to join the team. Years later, Lingo's son stated that the players took their job seriously and put the needs of the kennel often before practice. He also stated that some plays that they used were created on the spot.

The 1922 season was a rough outing for the Indians as Thorpe rarely played often choosing to coach then to play in games. Future Hall of Famer Joe Guyon didn't join until halfway through the season, and Pete Calac who had played on the Canton Bulldogs with Thorpe previously suffered career-threating injuries due to his service in WWI the years prior.

Despite this, the Indians started off the 1922 season with a strong 3-2 record before suffering a 62-0 loss to the former NFL Champion Akron Pros the following week. Instead of going into the locker rooms at halftime, the Indians instead did tricks using the Airedales as well as Indian dances and axe-throwing. They even had a player named Nick Lassa who was known to wrestle bears on occasion. This proved to be a huge draw for crowds and some wondered whether the players were there to play football or to show off the prized Airedales. 

The players themselves knew that Lingo didn't care much about winning and were known for frequently partying and drinking. There were two famous instances where this came to the helm for the team. The first time they asked for drinks after 2:00am which was illegal in Illinois at the time and stuffed the bartender into a phone booth and turned the bar upside down. Another instance they wanted to return to a hotel after a night of drinking but mistakenly took a trolley going the opposite direction and turned it around once they found out it was going the opposite direction. Although Thorpe was and still is regarded as one of the best all-around athletes of all time, he was known for being a poor coach and was notorious for having little discipline with his roster.  

Even though they returned for the 1923 season, the roster was substantially weaker and Thorpe, Guyon, and Calac missed a majority of the season with lingering injuries. They finished the season with a dismal 1-10 record getting their only win in the last game of the season against the Louisville Brecks.

One of the main reasons for their decline, both on and off the field is many fans came solely to see the halftime show and the novelty wore off after some time. The team disbanded in the 1923 offseason, and it formally folded in 1924. Funnily enough, Lingo and Thorpe fielded a basketball team under the same name in the late 1920s.

Even though he was injured during a majority of his time with the Indians, Joe Guyon played for the Canton Bulldogs, Washington Senators, Cleveland Indians, Rock Island Independents, Kansas City Cowboys, and New York Giants in addition to attending the famous Carlisle Indian School alongside Thorpe and under ""Pop"" Warner. He also helped the New York Giants win their first Championship in 1927 and was known for his unmatched versatility at any position both in the backfield and on the line. 

Unfortunately for Guyon, with the exception of the New York Giants, most of the teams he played for only lasted a few seasons and he retained a humble attitude which led to him getting largely overlooked and forgotten as time went on.  Thankfully for Guyon he was elected to both the College and the Pro Football Hall of Fame.

reddit,1kwnmhu,"Would you want to watch a WBC 2023 documentary about Team Japan with Ohtani, Darvish, Imanaga, Yamamoto, Nootbaar and more?. Hi, I hope it's okay to post this here — just wanted to hear from fellow baseball fans!

Is anyone here interested in watching a documentary or related TV programs about Team Japan in the 2023 WBC — featuring players like Shohei Ohtani, Yoshinobu Yamamoto, Shota Imanaga, Yu Darvish, and Lars Nootbaar?

If there’s enough interest, I’d like to work on making these available online with multilingual subtitles by the time the 2026 WBC begins.  Time is limited, so I’ll need to act fast.

In addition to the main documentary, I’m also hoping to stream two related TV programs. These would include interviews and behind-the-scenes stories from the players and coaches, as well as insights from Japanese pro baseball players who watched WBC 2023 — and from manager Hideki Kuriyama.

Watching these gave me so much courage, motivation, and energy. It also made me realize all over again how awesome baseball is!

I don’t know yet if I can get the rights to use the footage, or how much it might cost — but if many people want to see it, I’d like to use that support to help negotiate.

As for distribution, I’d love to hear your thoughts and ideas.                                                                Should it be ticket-based? Or should I try to find sponsors so it can be free to watch, even for kids? Would starting a community (like on Facebook) be helpful for exchanging ideas and gathering feedback?

Here’s what the documentary and TV programs would cover:                                                                    How SAMURAI JAPAN prepared for and fought through the 2023 WBC                                                                  -  The impact of MLB stars like Darvish and Ohtani on the team                                                                     -  Why Lars Nootbaar, the first Japanese-American player on the team, was so quickly embraced by Japanese fans                                                                                                                                                   -  The strength of the team’s bond and chemistry                                                                                          -  Honest thoughts and behind-the-scenes stories from the players, coaches, and manager

About Hideki Kuriyama, manager of Team Japan in WBC2023:                                                                   He was the manager of the Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters when Ohtani joined the team straight out of high school.

He pushed through strong resistance from coaches and team officials to develop Shohei into a successful two-way player.

A passionate and loving leader.

I just wanted to ask a question to see if anyone had ideas. So I'm from South Africa and it's been a dream of mine to work in baseball for years. I've worked myself up about as much as I can here in South Africa (national team coach and national committee member) and I've really developed a strong resume (as strong as I can here). But it's really hard to find any opportunities with employers that are willing to sponsor a work visa for me.

reddit,1kooft6,"A YouTube channel following the baseball team of Japan's prestigious Keio University is steadily increasing its subscriber base. The producer said, ""I want to create a program that will be a reference book for coaches,"" and has even covered Stanford University.. (Sorry, I'm using Google Translate so it might be hard to read)

YouTube channel ANDTV, which closely follows Keio University in the Tokyo Big 6 Baseball League, will celebrate its second anniversary on June 2nd. The channel's deep and detailed programming has captured the hearts of baseball fans, and in the past year the number of channel subscribers has increased dramatically from 3,000 to 15,000. Mitsuyasu Yamazaki is a graduate of Keio University's baseball team, a former producer at TV Tokyo's sports department, and currently the representative of AND LLC.

""Have you seen ANDTV?"" is the catchphrase for Tokyo Big 6 University Baseball fans. On the day of the Tokyo Big 6 University Baseball Tournament, if you take the train to the stadium, it is not uncommon to encounter fans watching ANDTV on the train. For the past two years, Yamazaki has conducted his own interviews at the training camps in Kagoshima and Asahikawa, and even at Stanford University across the ocean in the United States. He has responded to the fans' ""want to know"" desires.

""The most viewed video was the 'Returning to My Alma Mater Series' in which Takahashi Yoshinobu coaches the baseball team at his alma mater, Keio University, and it has been viewed almost 400,000 times. Many people also watched the struggles of the members who won the Koshien tournament, and the submission of the application to play professionally by Kiyohara Shogo. During the training camp for candidates for the university national team last summer, the Waseda University players told me, 'We all watch ANDTV in the dining hall at the dormitory' (laughs). That made me very happy.""

How does he make a living?

""My parents are farmers in Aichi Prefecture, and we're not wealthy or anything (laughs). In the two years since we started ANDTV, we've been living on a tight budget, having paid everything out of our own pocket. The ""savings"" I had from my time at TV Tokyo are running out, and if we carry on like this it will be difficult to continue production at the current pace, so I'm hoping to find a sponsor who will somehow support us in the future,"" he said.

The reality is that producing quality programs requires expenses such as travel expenses. For that reason, it is essential to increase the number of channel subscribers. The immediate goal is set at ""30703."" What does that mean?

""That is the number of seats at Jingu Stadium. I use the sold-out figure as a benchmark. If you think of the number of channel subscribers as ANDTV fans, then I would like to fill Jingu Stadium with people who love us. What I want to do is create the ideal media and television that contributes to Japan's sports culture,"" he says.

He set his mission as ""producing programs that will serve as reference books for baseball coaches.""

""In little league baseball, whether or not the coach can teach properly affects the interest of the children. If it's not interesting, they'll go and play soccer or basketball. Until now, we've mainly been delivering the coaching philosophy of Keio University coach Tetsuya Horii, but in the future, we'd like to expand the diversity of 'reference books'.""

Yamazaki is proud of the content, saying, ""It has become the most in-depth channel in Japan."" The channel has an unshakable reputation among current members of the Tokyo Big Six Baseball League, their families, and fans, but he wants to expand his audience to include more casual viewers.

""I really want more current students to come to Jingu Stadium. It would be great if this program could become a catalyst for that.""

He used to do everything from interviews to editing all by himself, but recently he says things have started to change.

""Current university students and people in their 20s started contacting us saying, 'If there's anything I can do, please let me help ANDTV.' I was so happy that I cried when I realized that it was especially resonating with the younger generation.""

If the circle of baseball-loving fans gradually expands and the number of channel subscribers reaches 30,703, the scope of freedom in producing programs will increase, enabling new developments.

""When you watch a game at Jingu Stadium, you sometimes hear some thoughtless heckling. But I want to turn all of that into cheers of support. I want to continue producing programs that are loved by not just 30,000 people, but 100,000, 300,000 people... I want to create a chemical reaction that will develop Japan's sports culture.""

The most important thing to create content that resonates with fans is passion. Yamazaki's videos have that. The circle of sympathy for ANDTV, which is filled with love for athletes, will continue to expand in the future.

reddit,1kxmz7q,"[OC] My Imaginary League: the EHL (European Hockey League). Something that I've been working on recently. Thoughts?


The imaginary lore:

A franchise-based professional ice hockey league consisting of 16 teams from Austria (1), Czechia (4), France (1), Germany (5), Slovakia (1), and Switzerland (3). 

In terms of skill level, the league is considered to be the third-best globally, after the NHL and KHL. For the 2024/2025 Season, the league had an average attendance of 10,430. Among hockey leagues, the EHL is widely considered to feature the third-highest level of skill, behind only the NHL and Russian KHL (with the gap between the EHL and KHL narrowing more each year).

The League consists of the following franchises: (English version of Name in brackets)

**West Division (8 Teams):**   
  
- 🇩🇪 **Düsseldorfer Radschläger** - (*Dusseldorf Cartwheelers* - often shortened to ""Wheelers"" )  
- 🇩🇪 **Kölner Haie** - (*Cologne Sharks*)   
- 🇩🇪** Adler Mannheim** - (*Mannheim Eagles*)  
- 🇩🇪 **Red Bull München** - (*Munich Red Bulls*)  
- 🇨🇭 **Zürich Lions  **
- 🇨🇭**SC Bern** - (The wordplay doesn't translate into English, usually just called ""*the Bears*."")
- 🇨🇭**Lynx de Lausanne** - (*Lausanne Lynx*. The Lynx play 2 home games each season in Geneva, during those games they called themselves the ""Lynx de Lac Leman"")
-🇫🇷 **Brûleurs de Loups de Grenoble** - (*Grenoble Wolf Burners*)  

  
**East Division (8 Teams)**      
  
- 🇩🇪 **Eisbären Berlin** - (*Berlin IceBears*)  
-🇨🇿 **Sparta Praha** - (*Prague Spartans*, but usually untranslated in English) 
-🇨🇿 **Dynamo Pardubice**  
-🇨🇿 **Kometa Brno** - (*Brno Comets*)  
-🇨🇿 **Ridera Ostrava** - (*Ostrava Riders*)  
-🇦🇹 **Vienna Capitals**  
-🇸🇰 **Slovan Bratislava** - (lit. translates to roughly ""Bratislava Slavs"" but the translated form is never used.)  
-🇸🇰 **Oceliari Košice** - (*Košice Steelers*)  

  
Teams play 58 Games per season: 6 Games against teams from their own division, and 2 Games against teams from the other divison. Top 4 teams from each division at the end of the season compete in the play-offs.  
  
Last year, it's teams had an average revenue of approx. ~€23M, of which around 40% came from ticket sales, 40% from media broadcasting rights deals, and 20% from merchandise/sponsorships/miscellaneous sources.   
  
Each EHL team has a soft salary cap of €12M. For every € a team spend above that on player salaries, they must contribute the same amount to a revenue-sharing ""pot"" with smaller teams. In accordance, with Swiss labour laws, there is no salary cap for individual players' salaries.


Most of the logos were redesigned/reworked by me, the only three that completely untouched are Dynamo, Kosice, and Bratislava. In some cases, it was just minor work like removing a wordmark or thickening some outlines, while others were more substantial. A couple were designed from scratch.
