reddit,1l3yf1o,"First prince of Rome, the tragic story of Agostino di Bartolomei *(I wanted to post this on 30th May, but got delayed to now. Tl;dr in comments)*

**Prologue**

As football drifts further from its' working class roots, the tradition of Romans captaining Roma is one of the last standing bastions of football romanticism. The idea behind *Romano e Romanista* is perhaps best embodied in Francesco Totti. De Rossi, Giuseppe Giannini and Florenzi were born and raised in this myth of being a Roma captain, but when did the tradition start?

**The Rise**

Post World War II, Roma is a laughing stock. They are ironically nicknamed 'Rometta' for their lack of success, and it all erupts in 1974, when their eternal rival Lazio win Scudetto. Romanisti are devastated, but little do they know, a talented player that will take the team to the unprecedented heights is maturing in Roma's *primavera.*

Agostino di Bartolomei was born and raised in Roma's working class neighborhood Tor Marancia. He spends his days at a local football field, and is soon noticed by Roma scouts. He first plays for Roma's satellite club, OMI Roma, and then goes to the main squad. There, he wins 2 youth championships, and debuts with the main squad as an 18 year old. Despite his talent, he was loaned to Vicenza due to fan unrest over him replacing beloved captain Ciccio Cordova.

'60s and '70s are not easy in Italy. Seemingly everyone owns a gun, violent protests happen daily, domestic terrorism is rampant. Roma is particularly unsafe, and *Anni di piombo* (The Years of Lead) take many lives, most notably prime minister, Aldo Moro, and Lazio star, Luciano Re Cecconi(another absurd story that deserves its' own essay). Even young Agostino is attacked in broad daylight by hooligans, who threaten him to leave Roma. At this point, he buys a gun, Smith & Wesson .38, for protection.

Back from Vicenza, he quickly cements his place in Roma's team. His vision and passing are unmatched. On the other hand, his lack of speed is proverbial at this point, but he makes up for it by analyzing the play like no one else. Playing in midfield also allows him to utilize his powerful long shot, and he is a designated penalty/free kick taker. In the second part of his career, he reinvents himself as libero, an idea  by his 'football father' Niels Liedholm, who perfectly described him:

\>""He never moves on pitch, unless absolutely needed.""

But above all else, he is THE captain. He takes young players under his own wing, he organizes team dinners and he leads by example. Off the pitch, he is the idol of every Romanista, someone who perfectly embodies the ideal of a local kid playing for his hometown team. It's at this time that he strikes a life-long bond with another 'Romano e Romanista', Bruno Conti.

With arrival of Dino Viola, Roma starts creating a powerhouse. In 1981, team led by Ago and his *little brother* Bruno Conti, loses Scudetto on the last day. But in 1983, Roma fixes the injustice of 1981 (referee saw the ""offside"" than no one else on the stadium saw, in favor of Juventus), and Ago finally lifts the much anticipated first Scudetto in modern era. City is bumping with joy, and optimism is through the roof. Yet, the 1984 could bring even more excitement, as Rome is set to host the final of European Cup.

**The downward spiral**

Roma fully focuses on European campaign, and they manage to reach the final after a highly controversial semi final against Dundee. And for the last match, the coronation of an entire city's dream, opponent is the strongest possible one, Liverpool. Match is tense, and it goes to penalties. Ago takes the responsibility and calmly scores his penalty, but Bruno Conti and Graziani miss theirs, and Liverpool is champion of Europe. The events of what happened next are disputed, but it is said that Ago, Conti, Ancelotti and others resented the star player, Falcao, for not taking the responsibility in shootout. Falcao himself said he couldn't do it because he was injured. Losing the biggest game of their lives heavily bears on players' shoulders, but Ago seems unusually influenced. He realizes that they lost what was one in a lifetime opportunity.

After the final, Ago rallies the team to win Coppa Italia, despite knowing he is being shown the door after the game. 'Il Barone' Liedholm is set to go back to his beloved Milan, and he invites Ago to go with him. Ago reluctantly accepts to leave his hometown, after being told by Viola that the incoming coach doesn't want 'has-beens'. Romanisti and Curva Sud show Ago their love in cup final, as he wins them one last trophy.

Next October, Ago scores in Milan-Roma and all the perceived injustice erupts in him and he celebrates the goal. This doesn't sit well with Romanisti and he is met with a mix of boos and cheers. He spends later years of his career helping early Berlusconi's Milan stabilize, leading minnows Cesena to a top half finish, and at 33, decides to join small Campanian team, Salernitana, to be closer to his wife's family.

Salerno marks the beginning of an end. Beloved by fans, he retires after getting them a historical promotion to Serie B. After the playing career, he writes a book for children(published by his son posthumously), starts a football academy and works as a pundit for RAI. However, the much-anticipated call from Roma never arrives, and he feels slighted. All he wants is Roma, but Dino Viola is notoriously against that 'Romanità' sentiment, and Ago never re-joins Roma. He buys land to expand his academy, but the bureaucracy of Salerno's local politicians (Camorra) stalls the process. Ago suffers from depression and feels like the light at the end of the tunnel is further and further away.

On May 30th 1994, the 10 year anniversary of unfortunate European Cup final, he asks his 11 year old son if he can skip school that day, so they can go to town center for an ice cream. His son has an important exam(?) and can't join his dad. Ago drives his son to school, comes back home, and at 9:30am, he takes the same Smith & Wesson .38 he bought 20 years earlier, and takes his own life. His suicide note is a love letter to his family, and he says he 'cant see a way out'. In his desk, they found 3 photos, his family, his patron saint and Roma's Curva Sud.

**Who was the man behind the myth?**

Agostino was a highly unorthodox man (and player) for the epoch he played in. He was shy, timid, introverted and rarely gave interviews. In a conservative society, he openly sympathized Communist party, and he was one of few players to call for boycott of Argentina World Cup due to human rights violations. Nonetheless, he was beloved by his teammates (Conti, Carlo Ancelotti, Tassotti, etc). Ancelotti credited his own man management skills to Ago, and Conti, who spent 50 years at various positions in Roma, always refers/ed to Ago as 'his captain'. Their bond off the field was so deep that it was Ago who carried captain's armband in Conti's farewell game in 1991, not Conti himself. This game between Roma greats and Brazil greats is also the last public appearance of Di Bartolomei, immortalized in the hug with distressed Conti, and the standing ovations he received while being substituted.

His death sends shockwaves across Italy. Despite being shy and introverted, he was loved by fans, teammates, famous singers and actors. Roma's administration doubles down in trying to erase his legacy, on the other hand. Only years later will this shame be rectified.

Today, Roma's training field bears his name, and annual youth tournament Coppa Ago honors him. Numerous documentaries, including one narrated by Alex Zanardi, celebrate his legacy. Movie by Oscar winner Paolo Sorrentino, *L'uomo in piu* is based on Ago. He is immortalized in two songs, by two of the greatest Italian songwriters of 20th century. First is *La leve calcistica della classe 68* by Francesco De Gregori, which follows a 12-year-old aspiring footballer named Nino (Ago’s childhood nickname) wearing number 7 (Bruno Conti’s number). *Tradimento e perdono* was written a decade after his death by Antonello Venditti, Ago's close friend, capturing the pain of a hero misunderstood in life and immortalized after death.",reddit_user_1l3yf1o,2025-06-05 05:52:34.000000,53,0,5,58,stadium naming,,soccer,8230,first prince rome tragic story agostino di bartolomei wanted post got delayed now tl dr comments prologue

reddit,1kym1q5,"The Happily Ever After (the Conference League trophy): Olympiacos FC, version 2025-26 Exactly 1 year ago, Olympiacos reached its highest peak of Greek club football, by winning the 2023-24 UEFA Conference League in rival AEK's stadium. For a recap of the season of wonders, you can read my post from last year [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1d4ys4g/catching_your_red_and_white_whale_olympiacos_fc/).

But happens after the fairytale ends, after the ""...and they lived happy ever after.""?

For Olympiacos, what happened was not as flashy, but was in my opinion enough to set the foundations for a new domestic empire and a consistent step-up for the club in European football. Let's start from the beginning!

***The summer:***

The no.1 demand of the fans, but also of coach Jose Luis Mendilibar, was to keep the basis of the Conference League winning team intact: the contracts of Ayoub El Kaabi, Konstantinos Tzolakis and captain Kostas Fortounis were expiring, while Daniel Podence, Andre Horta and David Carmo were on loan.

Owner Marinakis got a subpar grade in this assignment: while managing to renew prolific scorer El Kaabi (after 1 month long negotiations) and rising star goalkeeper Tzolakis (quite quickly), captain Fortounis parted ways with the club, opting to gain easy money in Saudi Arabia. Even worse was the situation with the players on loan: Marinakis does not usually pay the ""option to buy"" but wants to negotiate a lower price. Wolves would not sell Podence at the money Marinakis was offering, Podence himself wanted a pay rise, and after an all-summer long serial, the player (with Jorge Mendes' blessings) ended up...also in Saudi Arabia. Olympiacos did not pay the clause for Horta either, this one less of a blow since Mendilibar was not in love with the player.  The only one who remained in the end was Carmo, who returned in the end of August (technically bought by Forest, but that's FFP-related semantics) after seeing he wouldn't be a starter for Porto again.

This 3/6 was highly problematic, because Fortounis and Podence were the creative backbone of the team, and Olympiacos does not pay the kind of money that brings this level of guaranteed quality in the winger and no.10 position. Olympiacos also parted ways with Vicente Iborra (who wanted to return to Levante to help them return to La Liga, and suceeded), Stevan Jovetic (who opted to leave rather than come from the bench for another season), club legend Youssef El Arabi (38 now, wanted to keep playing regularly and this could not happen anymore here) and Quini (Olympiacos had signed a replacement RB since January), as well as some underwhelming players which nobody would miss like Omar Richards, Jovane Cabral and Fran Navarro.

With the chemistry already having taken a hit, since 3 starting players and 5-6 regular substitures left, the second blow was the *extremely poor* summer transfers in almost every attacking position:

https://preview.redd.it/equozwc0vr3f1.png?width=1451&format=png&auto=webp&s=cd657c3d33d1da7ba9f88fd8351dcbf1c48bda29

Willian and Sergio Oliveira performed as well as everyone expected, which means they sucked. Semi-retired veterans are for Olympiacos ""miss"" more often than ""hit"", and if for Willian the benefit of the doubt could be given, there was no such excuse for signing Oliveira, just ask any Galatasaray fan. Velde looked like a decent player in the pre-season...and that's it. He is simply not at the level a winger of Olympiacos needs to be, and seems to believe he is a far better player than he is. Yazici cannot be judged because he was extremely unlucky: he tore his ACL in his first match and never played again. Roman Yaremchuk was wasting so many chances to score until January that he had one foot out the door and was about to be replaced by a 31 year old Panserraikos CF with a career in the Spanish 3rd division - until he changed his fate (you will read about it below). Stamenic is the exact kind of player that will never work out for Olympiacos: slow, clumsy, physical, poor technique, perfect fit for Kilmarnock or Bristol Rovers, horrible fit for Olympiacos.

The 3 successful transfers were: Costinha, signed from January for the summer, who stepped up whenever needed at the RB position. Pirola, who despite a slow start, gelled with the other CBs and Tzolakis and was crucial many times during the season. And Dani Garcia, Mendilibar's sole personal transfer, who filled the ""Iborra"" gap with his experience and ""dirty"" game whenever needed (he is a moving yellow card).

***September to December:***

The unexpectedly tumultuous summer transfer-wise quickly brought trouble in the pitch as well: Mendilibar was never a master of creative football, but a fan of intense high-press to steal the ball as many times as possible, and a lot of crosses and long balls from the back. But this tactic does not always work when the opponent parks the bus (90% of Greek clubs), is very physical and there is nobody from Olympiacos capable of creating a gap with a personal moment. Cherry on top, Fortounis and Podence were the set piece takers, and useful as they are, Chiquinho and Rodinei are nowhere near as good at free kicks and corner kicks.

At the end of October, Olympiacos had only won 4 out of 9 Greek league matches, and the euphoria from the Conference League win was in the past. Europe was the saving grace: after a loss to Lyon, Olympiacos bounced back and beat Braga at home and Malmo away at the Europa League League Stage.

From there, Olympiacos started shifting gears. Mendilibar figured out which players could help and which could not, and everyone realized that 17 year old CF Kostoulas and CM Mouzakitis, the stars of the 2023-24 UEFA Youth League winning team (first ever trophy for a Greek club at Youth level too) were better than most players of the squad and could become semi-regular starters. Most importantly, the defense gelled together: Olympiacos did not lose again in Greece until April.

Mendilibar loves derbies: he doesn't have to face parked buses or extreme physicality, but teams who are trying to beat Olympiacos with their own football, rather than ""steal"" a result. After a 0-0 away draw against Panathinaikos, Olympiacos beat PAOK away 2-3 (with Kostoulas scoring his 1st goal) and demolished their favourite opponent AEK 4-1 at home. Morale did an 180, despite the draws against Rangers, Steaua and Twente in the Europa League (remember when I wrote Olympiacos struggles against physicality? These 3 matches were a prime example).

***January and February:***

This was the month where the players flipped the switch to ""we're gonna win in the end"" for good and the youngsters shone bright: 11th, Olympiacos is with the back against the wall against Aris at home, losing at HT, and Kostoulas comes in in the 2nd half, equalizes the game, and scores a 2nd goal for the win in the 96th minute (2-1). One week later, Tzolakis saves a last second penalty against Atromitos away (1-2). Five days later, Tzolakis is a wall in Dragao and the whole defense is flawless, with Olympiacos beating Porto away for the first time (0-1). The 1st leg against Panathinaikos in the cup (away) ends in a draw, with Yaremchuk scoring his 2nd goal for the club to equalize - and this goal kept him in the club for the rest of the season. A few days later, Olympiacos dispatch Qarabag at home (3-0) and secure Top 8 in the Europa League League Stage, and a direct spot in the Round of 16 amidst general euphoria: Ayoub El Kaabi with 7 goals in 8 matches (and 7/9 that Olympiacos scored, plus 2 missed penalties!) would be the top scorer of the competition in May, with Olympiacos having conceded only 3 goals in the League Stage.

In February, it's the other 17-year old's, Mouzakitis' time under the spotlights: a shot in the 87th minute for his first goal gives Olympiacos an away win against Levadiakos and 3 days later, a 95th minute wonderful goal wins the tie against Panathinaikos for the red and whites.

Meanwhile Marinakis is trying to undo some of the damage of the summer: Willian and Oliveira are sent packing, Horta returns (on loan again), alongside Luis Palma (on loan from Celtic) and substitute LB Bruno Onyemaechi (from Boavista).

***March to May:***

The final stretch of the season would be bittersweet for Olympiacos: domestic domination and a feeling of ""what if"" in the Europa League.

At the last match of February, Olympiacos fields a B team against the starters of AEK for the Cup, and rips them apart: 6-0! Yaremchuk and Horta score two each, Palma puts in a screamer, and Olympiacos savagely destroy the morale (and the season as it turned out) of their main competitor in the league until then. 4 days later, Olympiacos beats AEK again, this time in the league away, at the 90th minute. AEK never recovered from this week: they drew with Aris in the last match of the regular season and lost all 6 (!) play off matches: from -2 from Olympiacos the 2nd of March, they finished at -22.

And then there was the perfect storm that left Olympiacos with a bitter feeling: the away match against Bodo Glimt.

*Strike one:* El Kaabi got injured. El Kaabi had never got injured for 1.5 year, hadn't missed a single match (apart from an AFCON absence last year), and he got injured at the worst possible moment. As said before, he had scored 7/9 European goals of Olympiacos. He ended the season with 27, while the 2nd goalscorer had 10 - this was an absence impossible to replace.

*Strike two*: the plastic pitch in 0 degrees. For everyone who watched the match and had watched previous matches of Olympiacos, it was obvious that the players did not trust their legs to even run properly, much less tackle, slide or keep the offside line. Maybe it's Mendilibar's fault for not being prepared, but given how many teams (Lazio next week played even worse) lose in Bodo, maybe it's not that simple to just ""prepare"" for this surface in the cold.

*Strike three:* Yaremchuk had an off night and a match which should be an 1-goal win for Bodo according to xGoals ended 3-0.

The defeat turned out insurmountable: Olympiacos did not have El Kaabi next week either, lost Kostoulas too with an injury, and could only manage a 2-1 win (Yaremchuk scoring both goals).

After the national teams break, Olympiacos pushed for another match to de facto secure the title: 4-2 against Panatinaikos with an in-form Yaremchuk scoring twice more and Kostoulas sealing the win. From there half the players were thinking of their holidays, but this only cost a defeat to PAOK: Olympiacos can beat AEK even from the beach, and did so twice more in the play offs, and even managed to beat PAOK and Panathinaikos again in the last 2 matches, with Tzolakis raising a wall in 3 of these 4 matches. The season ended with the domestic double against OFI in the Cup Final in a match where Olympiacos did not face a single threat..

***Summary:***

Olympiacos didn't come close to a repeat of a monumental European season - it's not something you can do every year for sure, but was left with the feeling that it was doable if a few circumstances were different. The very good league stage also left high expectations for the future - if you are present every year, at some point you will be luckier as well - like last year.

The emphatic return to the domestic throne rendered the season successful, especially given the poor summer planning. Olympiacos is used to winning, winning and winning in Greece, and a 3rd year away from 1st place would be catastrophic.

Mendilibar also put an end to some poor streaks Olympiacos had in derbies, especially against Panathinaikos (with many many draws the last 2 years). Olympiacos stampeded AEK whenever they faced them (6-0, 4-1 and the match where they mathematically won the title at home, 90th minute 0-1 win away) and got a 4-2 win against Panathinaikos and PAOK each as well.

The return to the Champions League (thanks to the Title Holder rebalancing and taking advantage of the fact Olympiacos was the best ranked champion not already directly in the League Stage) is huge - the red and whites are planning to rebuild the financial gap they used to have from the domestic competition, and Champions League money is the means to it.

**Tzolakis:** After the baptism of fire in Istanbul last year (where he saved 3 penalties and sent Olympiacos to the Conference League Semi-Finals), he cemented himself as a modern, elite goalkeeper this season. Projecting confidence to his defenders, with quick thinking and good distribution, he was very often the cornerstone of victories for Olympiacos, and one of the main contributors of the 7th place in the Europa League League Stage. The 22 year old GK is in many ways the face of Mendilibar's Olympiacos since last year.

**Rodinei:** At age 32, Rodinei became a winger! Having some visible problems as a RB (partly due to fatigue since he was playing every 3 days the whole season), and with Olympiacos suffering in the winger position, the always enthusiastic to run forward Brazilian switched to a right winger for at least half the matches he started, and was the club's top assister in the season, and a key player in many big matches.

**El Kaabi:** Many thought the Morroccan could not repeat his previous season, and he proved them all wrong. 33 goals in 50 matches in the 2023/24 season, 27 in 44 mathces in the 2024/25 season. Top scorer of the UEFA Conference League in 2023/24, top scorer in the UEFA Europa League (despite not playing a single match after the League Stage!) in 2024/25. El Kaabi is irreplacable for Olympiacos, it was a huge moment of bad luck to not have him available in the Round of 16, and the club's top scorer of all time in Europe is ready to show what he can do in the Champions League next year.

**Chiquinho:** The Portuguese was asked to play as a no.10 and as a right winger (!) thanks to Marinakis' amazing transfer planning in the summer, and did a more than decent job in every position he played. He would never have the through ball of Fortounis or the set pieces of Valbuena, or the dribbling of Podence, but he does a lot of work and his numbers aren't half bad either: he is also always there to score in big matches.

**Hezze:** The Argentine didn't have a flashy season after his super promising debut season in Europe, but was solid in most of the matches at the midfield, and the CM/DM duet in the starting 11 starts from him. It's a blessing in disguise for Olympiacos in a sense that he didn't have some extreme stand-out match, because a lot of clubs are already eyeing him.

**Gelson Martins:** The most divisive player of the squad. Martins has tons of quality, is technically skilled, and is also consistently inconsistent and has brainfarts instead of decision-making skills. He was still the squad's best winger, but was far from what most Olympiacos fans expect from their starting winger.

**Ortega:** Perhaps the weak link of the defense, if there was one, not because he was poor, but because the rest were better. Ortega is a dog of war, but is error prone, and this exposed him several times. He is still really valuable in Mendilibar's system though.

**Costinha:** The Portuguese stepped up to cover the position of RB for most of the season when Rodinei moved forward, and did so with distinction: he was a bargain transfer from Rio Ave, and turned out to be a golden goose, especially given that he is still young.

**Carmo:** His quality is visible in every match he is locked in, his ceiling is very high and that's why Olympiacos wanted so badly to keep him, and wants to keep him next season too. One of the main contributors of the stellar defense, the only issue was that he was not always locked in, in several matches he gave the impression that he doesn't really 100% try (especially in the league) and that's why he didn't start as many matches as you would think.

**Pirola:** The Italian CB started slowly, but once he found chemistry with the rest of the defense, he was a net contributor in every match he played. One of the rare successful transfers of technical director Darko Kovacevic, Pirola gave Olympiacos' defense depth, and made it flexible to the occasional absence of Carmo or Retsos.

**Dani Garcia:** Dani Garcia is the type of player that usually won't hear his name from the fans, but is a key player in many derbies: an old school defensive midfielder, who has no qualms to kick the opponent down if he is about to go through, who knows exactly what's the limit of the referee's tolerance before he gets a yellow card, with tons of experience and fighting spirit. Despite his age (35), he deservedly renewed his contract for the new season.

**Retsos:** The Conference trophy lifted all the weight Retsos was carrying. Most of his usual individual mistakes ceased to happen, he became the CB who got a 20M transfer to Leverkusen at age 18 again. Unfortunately, the injuries that did not allow his career to skyrocket also returned - he missed almost a month twice in the season, and only started 26 matches out of the 49.

**Mouzakitis**: The baby-faced 18 year old introduced himself to the football world with [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1iije4w/olympiacos_10_panathinaikos_christos_mouzakitis/) tie-winning injury time goal against Panathinaikos. He had won over Olympiacos fans and Mendilibar months ago with his impecable technique, who can rival midfielders of elite European clubs. The future is all his - he has some physical and speed related issues to improve, but he is already talk of the town for many big clubs.

**Velde:** I am not sure who thought that ""yes, we should pay 4M to Lech Poznan for htis player"", but he needs his eyes checked. Velde would be a regular starter for AEK and a star player for Aris, but he cannot play for Olympiacos. He adds his name in a list of many names of underwhelming wingers which have lately played in the club. One dimensional, lacking decision making, good crossing, vision, patience, calm...

**Kostoulas:** The club's wonderkid transformed Olympiacos' attack many times during the season, scored crucial goals, has the physicality and technical skills of a seasoned professional, not just a high potential. Brighton is already floating numbers around the vicinity of 40M for him, but Olympiacos is not willing to sell this summer: Kostoulas is the academy's biggest success probably in history and the best is yet to come.

**Biancone:** The 25 year old Frenchman who looks 40 was the 4th CB of the squad, but played in many matches and despite having many ups and downs in his performance, he has leadership skills and impeccable technique for a CB, which rendered him a useful tool for the squad. He also renewed his contract for the next season.

**Stamenic:** Slow, clumsy, could not pass accurately to save his life, more or less what you expect from a New Zealand DM, and definitely not what Olympiacos needed. Failed transfer, luckily he was signed on loan from Forest so he isn't the club problem's anymore.

**Yaremchuk:** Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde for the Ukrainian, who spend the first half of the season wasting easy chance after easy chance, but ended up with 10 goals, 9 of them after January, all 9 in derbies and European matches! Maybe his psychology took an upwards turn, maybe he got luckier, Yaremchuk moves like a tank and is definitely not a bad player, and barely managed to show it before his time ran out. He will stay with the team next year as well.

**Ntoi:** The academy-raised CB who was part of the Conference League winning team (played the whole match in Istanbul) is not at the required level and everyone knew it. He got a few more chances in the 1st half of the season, before continuing on loan to Marinakis-owned Rio Ave, where he is expected to continue after the summer.

**Paschalakis:** Having accepted his role as 2nd GK, he played the 7 Cup matches. He isn't at the level of Tzolakis, but Olympiacos have done worse in the past in the 2nd GK position.

**Masouras:** Once a key starter, Masouras' performance was going from bad to worse for a while, and in December it was obvious he could not compete even with the quality-depleted wingers and emergency-wingers (Rodinei, Chiquinho) of Olympiacos, and was loaned to Bochum.

**Bruno:** Marinakis' transfer planning had left Olympiacos without an acceptable substitute LB in the summer, and Bruno came to cover this gap, and he did so successfully. If he's better than Ortega remains to be seen (he has mostly pace, he is still raw in several other aspects).

**Palma:** His screamer against AEK will be the best memory Olympiacos fans have from Palma, a rather invisible presence overall, a loan with low risk low reward which ended up exactly as most predicted: he is returning to Celtic and won't be missed.

**Apostolopoulos:** He had the luck to play several matches at LB because of the lack of options there until January, but is not an Olympiacos level player. He is continuing his career for Panaitolikos since January.

**Oliveira:** The least said, the better. Looking like a Sauber against a McLaren compared to any other player of the squad including Willian, and lacking any redeemable qualities for this inexcusable lack of speed, he was a baffling transfer in the first place. In the few matches he played, he was negative, and luckily the team currently in the bottom of the Brazilian league signed him in February.

**Andre Horta:** The club's failure to buy him in the summer had the fans furious, in the end he returned on loan in January, scored twice against his favourite opponent, AEK, and...got injured for 1.5 month. He was injury prone last year too, and this particular weakness will probably result in his buy-clause not to be triggered by Olympiacos.

**Willian:** Another ""Marcelo"" transfer, veteran with hugely successful career who is out of shape, out of sync, out of everything. Willian was trying, it's not that he came to earn money while pretending to work. He just couldn't make it click, and amicably parted ways in the end of December.

**Anagnostopoulos:** The 3rd GK who played the last home match of the season against PAOK, made a blunder in the 1st minute which resulted in a PAOK goal, but managed a few good saves and has now a 100% victory record as Olympiacos GK!

**Papakanellos:** Another member of the Youth League winning team, he had some guest appareances as a sub, never won over Mendilibar completely in order to start games. This pre-season will be crucial for him.

**Lolis:** Youth player team who had 1 sub appearence in the play offs.

**Androutsos:** Once a huge talent who never bloomed, he had his last match with Olympiacos last October, and is continuing his career with OFI.

**Yazici:** He arrived in September, and in his first sub appearance in October tore his ACL. Immensely unlucky, the plan is for him to stay in the team for the pre-season, so the club believes in him.

The ""ever after"" season of the fairytale was...normal. It wasn't a fairytale part 2, it was not a crash down to earth. It was Olympiacos taking advantage of what the historic Conference trophy earned them, to set the foundations for a domestic ""return to normal"", and despite a lot of mistakes in the summer, build a core of players ready to compete for the Top 24 of the Champions League next year.",reddit_user_1kym1q5,2025-05-29 13:59:20.000000,63,0,3,66,stadium naming,,soccer,23835,happily ever conference league

reddit,1kqscz5,"2025-2026 European qualifying dark horses, part 2: Lincoln Red Imps (Gibraltar) **[Part 0: introduction and selection criteria](https://old.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1kky6l4/20252026_european_qualifying_dark_horses/)**

**[Part 1: Virtus (San Marino)](https://old.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1kln6ob/20252026_european_qualifying_dark_horses_part_1/)**

With the unexpected performances of multiple Andorran teams last season, Gibraltar dropped down below Andorra to 54th—above only San Marino—in the UEFA country coefficient rankings. This might sound like Gibraltarian clubs severely underperformed, but most put in creditable displays; St. Joseph's suffered a one-goal aggregate defeat against eventual Irish champions Shelbourne, while Magpies overturned another League of Ireland side, Derry City, before an expected heavy defeat to FC Copenhagen.

If there was one club that slightly disappointed the expectations of some, it was serial champions and Gibraltar's only European group stage entrants, **Lincoln Red Imps**. Can they put it right this year and potentially repeat their historic feat of 2021?

**Club history**

Lincoln Red Imps, named after English club Lincoln City, were formed by Charles Polson in 1976, starting as a youth team in the fourth division with players from a police youth team and some others released from various Gibraltarian clubs. Several of the Lincoln team had been part of a highly rated Gibraltar U15 squad a few years prior; when they became old enough to play senior football, they were placed in the third division and their subsequent rise was rapid. In 1981-82, they were promoted to the second division, and following a mid-table finish, they won the league and reached the Gibraltar Premier League for the first time in 1984-85.

Lincoln's first season went about as well as one could imagine, as they were named joint champions with Glacis United, and they went on to win a further six titles by 1994. Eventually, the successful team began to age out and the next several years were a rebuilding phase for the club. Their focus on youth players and academy coaching, which had begun as early as the mid-1980s, paid dividends in the new millennium, as the club has since dominated Gibraltarian football like no other.

If you think the Bundesliga and Ligue 1 have a problem of one team dominating, the Gibraltar Football League puts things in perspective: since 2000, Lincoln have won 22 of 24 possible league titles (the league was abandoned during the peak of COVID), with a ridiculous 14 titles in a row between 2003 and 2016. They still hold the European league record for longest unbeaten run, lasting 88 matches from 2009 to 2014.

In recent years, Lincoln seem to have gotten rather bored of their domestic dominance and have turned their focus to building a squad fit for Europe. Of course, they attracted the attention of the world when, as massive underdogs, they managed a 1-0 home win against Celtic in 2016-17, but it's only recently that they've started to find some consistency; more on that later.

**Recent seasons and European performance**

The Gibraltarian league, which has no home or away matches as they are all played in one stadium, is divided into two phases: the normal league phase and the ""championship group"" of the top six teams, which determines the league champion with points from the league phase carried over. With a few exceptions—Europa FC being the usual challengers—Lincoln have been far and away the best team either overall or in the five games of the championship group.

However, in the last two seasons, a serious challenger has emerged in St. Joseph's FC, owned by former Burnley chairman Mike Garlick and coached by ex-Cádiz stalwart center-back Abraham Paz. Despite nearly going undefeated as they often do, Lincoln won the league by just two points in 2023-2024, and this past season they won it only on head-to-head points, the first tiebreaker, after St. Joseph posted an identical points total. In spite of these more nerve-wracking wins, Lincoln's record of 66 points in 25 games is hardly something to scoff at, and with the increasing valuations of their players as well as European experience, they will feel at least a second Conference League appearance is not out of reach.

Other than the miraculous first leg win against Celtic (which was followed by an expected 3-0 away loss), Lincoln's European history before 2021—beginning in 2014-15 after Gibraltar's recognition by UEFA—had consisted mostly of beating teams they were expected to beat and losing to better ones. However, their fortunes would change in 2021-22 with the introduction of the Conference League.

After destroying a terrible Fola Esch side from Luxembourg with a 7-2 aggregate win in the first round of Champions League qualifying, they put on creditable displays despite expected losses to CFR Cluj and Slovan Bratislava in CL and Europa League qualifiers, even recording an away draw in Slovakia. Even a Champions League first qualifying round win gets you to a Conference League playoff spot, and Lincoln's hopes of an unlikely Conference League group stage place hinged on a favorable playoff draw. They got one in a well-funded (by oligarch money) but nevertheless chronically underperforming team in Riga FC.

Lincoln entered the tie as underdogs, but with a challenging artificial pitch at home, a result in the away leg would put them in a good position in the tie. They got just that with a 1-1 draw in Latvia, and after a cagey affair in the home leg that ended in regular time with the same scoreline, Lincoln finally broke through—and led for the first time in the tie—with a goal from CB Roy Chipolina in the 105th minute.

Try as they might, Riga were unable to find an equalizer, and instead it was Lincoln who struck on the counter, the youngster Kian Ronan sealing the victory in the second minute of second-half added time in extra time. Remarkably, the 4-2 aggregate win saw Lincoln make history for Gibraltarian football, reaching the Conference League group stage as arguably the least fancied (and probably lowest valued) side in the competition proper.

Lincoln pulled up no trees in losing all six of their group stage matches, although they did manage to score against Slovan (again) and FC Copenhagen. In the following few European qualifiers, with some tougher draws, they failed to make it past their second tie, losing to teams with better quality such as Shkupi (despite nearly mounting a comeback with a 2-0 home win), Tobol, and Ballkani in decisive matches.

A favorable draw in the first round of Champions League qualifying is always a boost for teams of Lincoln's size, as we already saw in 2021-22, and it happened again in 2024 as they were drawn against Maltese champions Ħamrun Spartans. I felt this would be a fascinating tie between two growing and ambitious clubs, and so it proved. Lincoln grabbed a priceless away win courtesy of Ethan Britto, but a 5th minute red card for Dan Bent in the second leg at home left them in serious danger. Lincoln defended their lead gamely and nearly saw it through but were undone by an 89th minute aggregate equalizer from Brazilian striker Vitão. In a chaotic period of extra time, neither team was able to find the decisive goal and the match went to penalties, with a Steve Borg miss knocking out the Maltese side and sending Lincoln through.

The second qualifying round saw Lincoln demolished 0-7 on aggregate by an old nemesis, Azerbaijani side Qarabağ, before nearly pulling a rabbit out of their hat in a 2-3 aggregate loss against Belarusian side Dinamo Minsk in Europa League qualifying. Thus, just as in 2021-22, the Gibraltarian champions were left looking for a favorable playoff draw to fuel their Conference League ambitions...and once again, they got it in the shape of Larne, champions of Northern Ireland.

Although highly touted before the qualifiers and having a very strong league record, Larne were annihilated 0-7 by Latvian champions RFS and, after a bye in the second round of Conference League qualifying, scraped by on penalties past a very shaky Ballkani side that had lost to Andorran side UE Santa Coloma in their previous round. However, Lincoln were unable to dominate their opponents and fell apart defensively; their 2-1 lead from a home win evaporated in Northern Ireland as an Andy Ryan hattrick (including two penalties) consigned Lincoln to elimination despite them playing half an hour against ten men.

In short, it has been up and down for Lincoln since their history-making run a few years ago; if they are to make a European group stage again, they will need more consistent ""ups"".

**How far can they go?**

Transfermarkt puts Lincoln's squad value at 2.3 million euros, roughly in line with the likes of TNS and Larne, some of the lower-seeded sides to reach the Conference League groups this season. With a combination of Gibraltarian internationals, experienced Spanish lower division players and potential quality additions from further afield like Serbian former youth international goalkeeper Stefan Čupić and young Estonian striker Mattias Männilaan, they should have the quality to at least reach the Conference League playoffs again. Spaniard Juanjo Bezares has also impressed as manager, being handed the Lincoln job permanently just a few days ago after winning all five championship group matches in an interim capacity. With another favorable draw, reaching the league stage could be a real possibility, although some difficult ties could likewise see them exit in the third qualifying round.

One of the potential pitfalls for Lincoln is an aging team, with two of their six most used players being in their late thirties or older and several others past their physical prime. While it would certainly benefit team cohesion that several of the players have been at the club for a long time, fitness might become an issue in a long qualifying campaign.

**Fun fact:** Panathinaikos fans may remember Nano, now 40 years old, who has played the most minutes of anyone at Lincoln Red Imps this season and featured in all 20 league games. He can still produce some magic, too, with ten goal contributions (seven goals and three assists.)

**Fun fact 2:** Policeman Lee Casciaro, who scored the only goal against Celtic and Gibraltar's first international goal, is still playing for Lincoln at age 43, although he has only scored a single goal this season.

reddit,1kk3myy,"Draft Lottery is Tomorrow: Here are the predetermined ""fixes"" for each team With the draft lottery tomorrow, the fans of teams who didn't make the post-season have their favourite year-end event: the draft lottery

Every time the draft lottery is held, we begin to hear suggestions that it was fixed/rigged, with proof! What proof will there be this year? Below are all potential proofs lottery conspiracy theorists may come up with for why Flagg was always destined to go to the lottery winners.

**Utah Jazz**: White.

**Washington Wizards**  - On October 21st, 2024 Wizards owner Ted Leonsis suddenly announced he had entered an agreement to keep the Wizards in DC, ending chatter about a move to Virginia. Agreement promised a new stadium renovation, and that the team could not consider relocation until 2045. Why the sudden change from Leonsis? He must've been promised the rights to Cooper Flagg of course. Not to mention someone named Flagg playing for the nation's capital? Too obvious.

**Charlotte Hornets**: LaMelo is one of the most popular young players in the league, leading the East backcourt in All-Star votes. Play seems rather obvious here. Pair him with Flagg and you've given Gen Z its team. Plus, the Hornets were sold in summer 2023. New ownership didn’t care about the shitty 2024 draft though, so the league must’ve promised them the #1 pick in 2025 of course.

**New Orleans Pelicans**: We saw how much attention the Pelicans and Zion got when he was a rookie. He needs a partner in crime. Who better than another 'generational' Duke prospect in Flagg?

**Philadelphia 76ers**: Philly is a massive market, with one of the most talked-about superstars in the league in Joel Embiid. The franchise is on life support right now, and the NBA doesn't want to lose out - giving them Flagg would fix this.  

**Brooklyn Nets**: The Nets reside in the biggest market in the league, yet they haven't quite shed the Knicks' little brother label. Giving them Flagg could change things.

**Toronto Raptors**: With the lottery being rigged every year, the NBA needs to throw in curveballs here and there to throw fans off the scent. Can’t rig it every year, it’d be too obvious. Give Flagg to the Raptors to accomplish this.

**San Antonio Spurs**: The league wants Wemby to be the face of the league, and he can’t be the face of the league with a middling roster. Give him another stud to pair with Fox and let the ratings flow in.

**Houston Rockets (PHX unprotected pick)**: Houston is a *huge* market on the brink of a dynasty. We just saw how great they performed in the playoffs. Adding Flagg to that high-flying (and Sengun) core is guaranteed ratings, and also ensures a great environment for Flagg to grow and develop into the modern American superstar the NBA needs. Combine that with the built-in China market from Yao, and a successful franchise in Houston would only be a positive for the league.

**Portland Trail Blazers**: Portland refused to tank this year, going on a meaningless run at the end of the season. NBA wants to send a message to the likes of Utah and Washington that tanking won’t help, so they give Flagg to Portland.

**Dallas Mavericks**: Self explanatory. We all know what’s going on here…

**Chicago Bulls**: Chicago is an absolutely massive market that’s been struggling. The NBA is simply a better place when Chicago is good. Easy decision to send Flagg here

**Sacramento Kings**: The Kings just months ago sent their franchise player, De’Aaron Fox, to the Spurs to play with Wemby, and received a pittance in return. Why would they do that??? Well with Wemby being the next face of the league, the NBA desperately needed a star next to him. After being promised Flagg, the Kings acquiesced and gave Fox for next to nothing, because Flagg was the real prize.. 

**Atlanta Hawks**: #1 overall pick back to back years? Psh, yeah, right.

reddit,1kzd2zd,"Defunct Team Spotlight: Pottsville Maroons Today the NFL we know is made up of 32 teams from medium and large cities from across the nation, but few remember the landscape of the NFL 100 years ago. Instead of teams playing in cities like Los Angeles, Seattle, Houston or Miami, you had teams popping up in places like Rock Island, Pottsville, Tonawanda, and Muncie. A majority of these teams are largely forgotten and the cities themselves too small in the present day to support a franchise with the exception of Green Bay.

One of the most interesting teams from this time period in my humble opinion were the Pottsville Maroons hailing from the small coal mining town in Eastern Pennsylvania.

I don't know if anyone else has highlighted them in here, but I want to give flowers to some defunct franchises who shaped the league that we know and love today.

Originally being founded in 1920 as an independent team, they joined the Anthracite League in 1924. This league was made up of 5 Eastern Pennsylvania coal mining towns. This league was short lived folding after only one season and the Maroons left for the NFL in 1925.

Few if any expected the newly joined franchise to be successful in their first season, but they surprised many with 10-2 which landed them 2nd place in league standings that year. Looking back at them 100 years later it seems like they fell just short of the Championship that year, but the truth is that the debacle that was the 1925 Championship controversy.

It all started when the Maroons beat the Chicago Cardinals on December 6th, 1925, at Comiskey Park in Chicago. This was no small feat as the Cardinals were the top team in the NFL that year and the frontrunners for the 1925 Championship at that point in the season. The following week they were scheduled to play the Notre Dame All-Stars featuring the legendary ""Four Horsemen"" and Knute Rockne at the helm.

The Frankford Yellow Jackets, who played out of Philadelphia, had secured the rights to play the Notre Dame squad, but once the Maroons pulled ahead of them in league standings the NFL granted them permission to take their place. Maroons' owner John Striegel had booked Shibe Field in Philadelphia for the two teams to play at due to its larger capacity than their home field, which was Minersville Park. This action infringed upon the Yellow Jacket's territory, and NFL commissioner Joe Carr warned the Maroons that they would be suspended if they proceeded with the game. Striegel, not wanting to lose the money that he had paid for to use the stadium went ahead anyways with the game and claimed that the NFL had given him permission to do so although. However, when asked about it years later gave differing details.

Fortunately for the Maroons, they beat Notre Dame 9-7 which was seen as a major win for the legitimacy of the NFL against one of the top teams in college football. On the flip side, Carr carried with his original threat and suspended the Maroons following the game.

In a strange twist of events, the Chicago Cardinals who then were #1 in league standings following the Maroons suspension fixed a game against the Milwaukee Badgers who used high school players to fill their roster which was illegal. With the Maroons now suspended, the NFL offered the Cardinals the Championship but, Cardinals owner Chris O'Brien declined on the grounds that the Maroons had beaten them earlier in the season and the NFL never officially awarded a winner for the 1925 season.

This is also where the Cardinals curse was born as the Bidwill family who took over the Cardinals in 1933 claimed the title as theirs and have since only won one NFL championship in 1947 and remain the oldest professional sports franchise to not have won a championship in the modern era. (Sorry Cardinals fans)

Ironically, the Maroons suspension was short lived as Joe Carr immediately reinstated them to avoid them joining the AFL in 1926. (Not the AFL that we know, there was actually three different AFL's this one was created by Red Grange's agent C.C. Pyle after contract negotiations fell through) They put up another strong outing in 1926 with a 10-2-2 record but it was only enough to finish 3rd in standings, and they were only able to muster a 7-16 record the following record in the 2 seasons that followed.

After the 1928 season John Striegel sold the Maroons to a Boston based company and the franchise folded for good after a 4-4 season. Interestingly enough, some claim that the Commanders are a continuation of the Maroons due to their similar colors and both franchises being based in Boston. Neither the NFL nor the Commanders recognize this connection, but it is still interesting, nonetheless.

Even though their time in the NFL was short they played a part in innovating the NFL as we know it. The Maroons were the first NFL franchise to play a night game to boost fan attendance to allow for coal miners and factory workers to attend games.

They also had 3 Hall of Famers play for their team who were Pete Henry, Walt Kiesling, and John ""Blood"" McNally. They also had arguably one of the most underrated players of the time in Tony Latone play for them for their whole franchise's history. Hailing from the small coal mining town of Edwardsville, Latone captured the tough, hard-nosed spirit that captured the 1920s to a tee. Not only did he have more rushing touchdowns and yards than Bears Hall of Famer Red Grange, but he is one of the few players to knock Grange out in a game and Grange himself is quoted as saying that he couldn't get paid enough to take a hit from Latone. Unfortunately for Latone, he was never named to an All-Pro team in his career due to the small market of Pottsville, but he got his flowers in 2021 when he was added to the Pro Football Research Association's Hall of Very Good.

Thank you to all who take the time to read this, and I hope that I can honor the Maroons at least to some degree. Feel free to comment other defunct franchises for me to spotlight in the future I am more than open to suggestions.

reddit,1l2n5gr,"Defunct Team Spotlight: Providence Steam Roller Last week I took you guys to the small coal mining town in central Pennsylvania of Pottsville. Today we travel 300 miles northeast to the city of Providence, Rhode Island.

Originally founded in 1916 by three members of the *Providence Journal*, the team started out as a small semi-pro team and gradually gained prestige eventually gaining the title of best independent team in the nation by the early 1920s.

1924 was a truly a game-changing year as they played 5 NFL teams that season and beating 3 of them, the Minneapolis Marines, Rochester Jeffersons, and Dayton Triangles. This did not go unnoticed by the NFL who offered them a place in the NFL for the 1925 season. Playing at the Providence Cycledrome, (bicycle racing track) the Steam Rollers started their first few seasons in the NFL with mediocre records of 6-5-1 and 5-7-1 before making significant changes in 1927.

During the 1927 offseason, the steamrollers signed star QB and future Hall of Famer Jimmy Conzelman and ""Wildcat"" Wilson who had been an All-American at the University of Washington and had played for the Los Angeles Wildcats in the AFL the previous season. This marked the beginning of the turnaround for the franchise as they improved to 8 wins and finished 5th in league standings.

Starting off the 1928 season with a 20-7 rout of Red Grange and the New York Yankees (not the Yankees of baseball, there were a lot of NFL teams who copied M L B names in order to build fanbases in the early years of the NFL) the Steam Rollers finished with a season record of 8-1-2 which was enough for them to win the NFL Championship that year. Interestingly enough, the Frankford Yellow Jackets won more games than them that season, but the NFL decided to switch from most overall wins for a team to win percentage in order to determine a championship winner.

It's also funny that it was the Yellow Jackets who were on the wrong end of the stick for this change in rules if you remember what happened last week when I discussed the Maroons and the Yellow Jackets owner complaining about the Maroons violating their territory.

Following their victory, the city of Providence held a victory banquet in which each player received a gold watch for their efforts on the team. Jimmy Conzelman also received a trophy and named the teams ""Most Valuable Player"".

Unfortunately for the Steam Rollers, this was ultimately the height of their success as the downward spiral of the team began the following season. During the 1928 season, the Steam Rollers had had 5 players named to the All-Pro team, but 3 of those players left the team and the two others sustained injuries that kept them out of most of the season. Jimmy Conzelman was unable to fully recover from a knee injury the previous season and his performance was limited.

Funnily enough, one of the players who had left the Steam Rollers, Gus Sonnenberg who had been a bruising halfback left to pursue a career as a professional wrestler.  His rationale for this decision was based on the fact that he had become the world heavyweight champion and was receiving better pay than he had on the Steam Rollers. He was a three-time heavyweight wrestling champion and was inducted into the Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame in 2007.

The 1929 Steam Rollers were only able to put up a 4-6-2 record and after another two more below average seasons the owners of the Steam Rollers were forced to sell the team back to the NFL after the 1931 season due to financial shortcomings and the toll of the Great Depression.

Even though the team only lasted 7 seasons there were many NFL firsts that the Steam Rollers pioneered. The first of these was the first team to play at a bicycle racing stadium. They are also the only team to play 4 games in 6 days that proved to be disastrous for the team as they came out of the marathon with a 0-3-1 record. Due to heavy rain the previous day, the NFL hastily set up the first night game in league history when the Steam Rollers hosted the Chicago Cardinals on November 3, 1929, under the floodlights of Kinsley Park in Providence.

The name for the team comes from team co-owner, Charles Coppen hearing a fan saying that the other team was ""getting steamrolled"" and he loved it so much that he named the team that. Even though the team folded in 1931, a BAA (Basketball Association of America who later joined the N B A) had a franchise in 1946 under the name Providence Steam Rollers.

Over the course of their 7-year history, the Steam Rollers had two Hall of Famers play for them in the likes of Fritz Pollard who was the first African American player in NFL history and co-coach of the 1920 Akron Pros and Jimmy Conzelman who played/coached for them from 1927-1929. Conzelman is one of those forgotten early playmakers of the 1920s NFL, but he played a big part in the growth of the NFL.

Playing for the Decatur Staleys, Rock Island Independents, Milwaukee Badgers, Detroit Panthers, and Providence Steam Rollers over the course of his 10-year career. Jumping from team to team was common in the early days when contracts were for a set number of games instead of on a season-by-season basis like it is in modern times, but I think there is some commonality with a modern-day sports figure who had a similar career timeline as Conzelman. Even though Conzelman was a good QB and coach for the teams he was on, the talent around his was often sub-par at best and he didn't enjoy championship success until he joined the Steam Rollers in 1927.

The modern-day equivalent of Jimmy Conzelman is Kevin Durant of the N B A. I know this may seem very nuanced and odd but let me break down the similarities. Both men were known for their intelligent play, team hopping in search of championships and success, had off-the-field personas, and being criminally underrated for their respective time. Kevin Durant is the modern-day equivalent of what Jimmy Conzelman was to early football, an elite, intelligent players who were often under credited for their impact on their respective sports.

Luckily for Conzelman, he was elected to the Hall of Fame in 1964, to which he himself refused at first because he believed there were players more deserving than him. He was also named to the Arizona Cardinals Ring of Honor for his role as coaching their 1947 championship team.

Thank you again for taking the time to read this and feel free to comment which defunct team I should cover next!
