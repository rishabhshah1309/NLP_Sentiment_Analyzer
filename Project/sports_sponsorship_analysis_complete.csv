1kk3myy,nba,"Draft Lottery is Tomorrow: Here are the predetermined ""fixes"" for each team","With the draft lottery tomorrow, the fans of teams who didn't make the post-season have their favourite year-end event: the draft lottery

Every time the draft lottery is held, we begin to hear suggestions that it was fixed/rigged, with proof! What proof will there be this year? Below are all potential proofs lottery conspiracy theorists may come up with for why Flagg was always destined to go to the lottery winners.

**Utah Jazz**: White.

**Washington Wizards**  - On October 21st, 2024 Wizards owner Ted Leonsis suddenly announced he had entered an agreement to keep the Wizards in DC, ending chatter about a move to Virginia. Agreement promised a new stadium renovation, and that the team could not consider relocation until 2045. Why the sudden change from Leonsis? He must've been promised the rights to Cooper Flagg of course. Not to mention someone named Flagg playing for the nation's capital? Too obvious.

**Charlotte Hornets**: LaMelo is one of the most popular young players in the league, leading the East backcourt in All-Star votes. Play seems rather obvious here. Pair him with Flagg and you've given Gen Z its team. Plus, the Hornets were sold in summer 2023. New ownership didn’t care about the shitty 2024 draft though, so the league must’ve promised them the #1 pick in 2025 of course.

**New Orleans Pelicans**: We saw how much attention the Pelicans and Zion got when he was a rookie. He needs a partner in crime. Who better than another 'generational' Duke prospect in Flagg?

**Philadelphia 76ers**: Philly is a massive market, with one of the most talked-about superstars in the league in Joel Embiid. The franchise is on life support right now, and the NBA doesn't want to lose out - giving them Flagg would fix this.  

**Brooklyn Nets**: The Nets reside in the biggest market in the league, yet they haven't quite shed the Knicks' little brother label. Giving them Flagg could change things.

**Toronto Raptors**: With the lottery being rigged every year, the NBA needs to throw in curveballs here and there to throw fans off the scent. Can’t rig it every year, it’d be too obvious. Give Flagg to the Raptors to accomplish this.

**San Antonio Spurs**: The league wants Wemby to be the face of the league, and he can’t be the face of the league with a middling roster. Give him another stud to pair with Fox and let the ratings flow in.

**Houston Rockets (PHX unprotected pick)**: Houston is a *huge* market on the brink of a dynasty. We just saw how great they performed in the playoffs. Adding Flagg to that high-flying (and Sengun) core is guaranteed ratings, and also ensures a great environment for Flagg to grow and develop into the modern American superstar the NBA needs. Combine that with the built-in China market from Yao, and a successful franchise in Houston would only be a positive for the league.

**Portland Trail Blazers**: Portland refused to tank this year, going on a meaningless run at the end of the season. NBA wants to send a message to the likes of Utah and Washington that tanking won’t help, so they give Flagg to Portland.

**Dallas Mavericks**: Self explanatory. We all know what’s going on here…

**Chicago Bulls**: Chicago is an absolutely massive market that’s been struggling. The NBA is simply a better place when Chicago is good. Easy decision to send Flagg here

**Sacramento Kings**: The Kings just months ago sent their franchise player, De’Aaron Fox, to the Spurs to play with Wemby, and received a pittance in return. Why would they do that??? Well with Wemby being the next face of the league, the NBA desperately needed a star next to him. After being promised Flagg, the Kings acquiesced and gave Fox for next to nothing, because Flagg was the real prize.. 

**Atlanta Hawks**: #1 overall pick back to back years? Psh, yeah, right.

1kzd2zd,nfl,Defunct Team Spotlight: Pottsville Maroons,"Today the NFL we know is made up of 32 teams from medium and large cities from across the nation, but few remember the landscape of the NFL 100 years ago. Instead of teams playing in cities like Los Angeles, Seattle, Houston or Miami, you had teams popping up in places like Rock Island, Pottsville, Tonawanda, and Muncie. A majority of these teams are largely forgotten and the cities themselves too small in the present day to support a franchise with the exception of Green Bay.

One of the most interesting teams from this time period in my humble opinion were the Pottsville Maroons hailing from the small coal mining town in Eastern Pennsylvania.

I don't know if anyone else has highlighted them in here, but I want to give flowers to some defunct franchises who shaped the league that we know and love today.

Originally being founded in 1920 as an independent team, they joined the Anthracite League in 1924. This league was made up of 5 Eastern Pennsylvania coal mining towns. This league was short lived folding after only one season and the Maroons left for the NFL in 1925.

Few if any expected the newly joined franchise to be successful in their first season, but they surprised many with 10-2 which landed them 2nd place in league standings that year. Looking back at them 100 years later it seems like they fell just short of the Championship that year, but the truth is that the debacle that was the 1925 Championship controversy.

It all started when the Maroons beat the Chicago Cardinals on December 6th, 1925, at Comiskey Park in Chicago. This was no small feat as the Cardinals were the top team in the NFL that year and the frontrunners for the 1925 Championship at that point in the season. The following week they were scheduled to play the Notre Dame All-Stars featuring the legendary ""Four Horsemen"" and Knute Rockne at the helm.

The Frankford Yellow Jackets, who played out of Philadelphia, had secured the rights to play the Notre Dame squad, but once the Maroons pulled ahead of them in league standings the NFL granted them permission to take their place. Maroons' owner John Striegel had booked Shibe Field in Philadelphia for the two teams to play at due to its larger capacity than their home field, which was Minersville Park. This action infringed upon the Yellow Jacket's territory, and NFL commissioner Joe Carr warned the Maroons that they would be suspended if they proceeded with the game. Striegel, not wanting to lose the money that he had paid for to use the stadium went ahead anyways with the game and claimed that the NFL had given him permission to do so although. However, when asked about it years later gave differing details.

Fortunately for the Maroons, they beat Notre Dame 9-7 which was seen as a major win for the legitimacy of the NFL against one of the top teams in college football. On the flip side, Carr carried with his original threat and suspended the Maroons following the game.

In a strange twist of events, the Chicago Cardinals who then were #1 in league standings following the Maroons suspension fixed a game against the Milwaukee Badgers who used high school players to fill their roster which was illegal. With the Maroons now suspended, the NFL offered the Cardinals the Championship but, Cardinals owner Chris O'Brien declined on the grounds that the Maroons had beaten them earlier in the season and the NFL never officially awarded a winner for the 1925 season.

This is also where the Cardinals curse was born as the Bidwill family who took over the Cardinals in 1933 claimed the title as theirs and have since only won one NFL championship in 1947 and remain the oldest professional sports franchise to not have won a championship in the modern era. (Sorry Cardinals fans)

Ironically, the Maroons suspension was short lived as Joe Carr immediately reinstated them to avoid them joining the AFL in 1926. (Not the AFL that we know, there was actually three different AFL's this one was created by Red Grange's agent C.C. Pyle after contract negotiations fell through) They put up another strong outing in 1926 with a 10-2-2 record but it was only enough to finish 3rd in standings, and they were only able to muster a 7-16 record the following record in the 2 seasons that followed.

After the 1928 season John Striegel sold the Maroons to a Boston based company and the franchise folded for good after a 4-4 season. Interestingly enough, some claim that the Commanders are a continuation of the Maroons due to their similar colors and both franchises being based in Boston. Neither the NFL nor the Commanders recognize this connection, but it is still interesting, nonetheless.

Even though their time in the NFL was short they played a part in innovating the NFL as we know it. The Maroons were the first NFL franchise to play a night game to boost fan attendance to allow for coal miners and factory workers to attend games.

They also had 3 Hall of Famers play for their team who were Pete Henry, Walt Kiesling, and John ""Blood"" McNally. They also had arguably one of the most underrated players of the time in Tony Latone play for them for their whole franchise's history. Hailing from the small coal mining town of Edwardsville, Latone captured the tough, hard-nosed spirit that captured the 1920s to a tee. Not only did he have more rushing touchdowns and yards than Bears Hall of Famer Red Grange, but he is one of the few players to knock Grange out in a game and Grange himself is quoted as saying that he couldn't get paid enough to take a hit from Latone. Unfortunately for Latone, he was never named to an All-Pro team in his career due to the small market of Pottsville, but he got his flowers in 2021 when he was added to the Pro Football Research Association's Hall of Very Good.

Thank you to all who take the time to read this, and I hope that I can honor the Maroons at least to some degree. Feel free to comment other defunct franchises for me to spotlight in the future I am more than open to suggestions.
