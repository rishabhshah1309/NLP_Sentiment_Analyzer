They’re certainly more at blame than the athletes. It always amazes me that people say athletes should forgo the fuck ton of money they could get from sponsorships because said company uses slave labor. Or they should drop their potentially one chance at competing in the olympics because of China’s atrocities.

8,reddit,sports,sports sponsorship,[META] On the Qatar slavery trend,"*I guess that I'll get downvoted to oblivion (a friend referred to this as a hara-karma) for speaking against the ""dominant"" perspective on Qatari worker rights issues, but hey let's try that.*

Well, it's been about a day since the Qatar-denounciation trend launched. I can't say that I'm favourable to the current human rights situation of Qatar, but in my opinion it is a huge double standard that's dominating this subreddit.

So, let's begin with the post that began all of that, the [Coke](http://i.imgur.com/6WHbsFa.png) one. You know, I guess, that Coke is also responsible for [environmental destruction](http://www.theguardian.com/money/2006/mar/19/business.india1) in a lot of countries, and still, people are more shocked about the fact that they give money to a country that uses slave workers than about the ""regular"" shit they do.

Let's move on Adidas. Let's say that they cancel their World Cup sponsorship. Guess what? They'll still have a metric fuckton of [slaves](http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/apr/14/olympics-adidas-clothing-sweatshops) to make *your* clothes.

And now for the organisation that organises this tournament: FIFA. They established special courts for the [2010 South Africa World Cup](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/21/sports/soccer/21iht-wcsoccer.html) and pressured Brazil, Russia and Qatar into dropping their restrictions on alcohol consumption for the [2014, 2018 and 2022 World Cups](http://www.latinpost.com/articles/15443/20140623/fifa-world-cup-sponsors-budweiser-partnership-changing-alcohol-bans-brazil.htm).

What really annoys me is that western countries and companies exploit people on the other side of the world pretty much every day to sustain what you call *high standard of living*, and that FIFA has been an awful organisation for a while now. But suddenly, it's about Qatar, so everybody can talk shit on the 2022 World Cup. The 2018 World Cup is to be held in Russia, and so were the Sochi Olympic Games, but apparently conducting military operations on foreign soil, rigging elections and doing a lot of other awful stuff is better than a worker a day dying.

In my opinion, we are simply witnessing the First World attacking a non-First World country based on its ethical standards, standards that we don't even respect ourselves. It simply shows how easy it is to forget deaths happening thousands of kilometres away from you to produce *your* shit and to think that we are nonetheless countries with high moral and ethical standards.

**Tl;Dr** If Qatar stopped using slave workers, that'd be great, but it's just hypocritical to attack the sponsors about the World Cup while Coke, Adidas, etc... have had awful human rights and environmental records for years while nobody seemed to give a shit about it before.

---

*Addentum*

Note that I am in no way condoning Qatar's use of slave workers at all, however it seems that this topic is subject to a dangerous double standard, with Qatar and the sponsors getting all the shit and, in the meantime, other issues that have been here for far longer are not being discussed. Coke and Adidas aren't going to be less of two slave-owning, earth-poisoning companies if they retract their sponsorship (as I already said).

In a random coincidence I know two of the more obscure people on this list and I can tell you that their numbers are greatly overstated.
Why the hell is the top auto-racer paid $40,000,000? Does auto-racing really have a big enough draw that their top racers get paid that much? I've never even heard the name Fernando Alonso, and he's getting paid more than every athlete I've heard of, besides Pacquiao.

Agreed.  I figured Adrian Peterson would be at the top, or Chris Johnson, depending on when either dude reupped their contracts.  I honestly had to look up Charles Johnson.
It was the $30 million signing bonus that really put him up there.  The Panthers *really* did not want him to sign with Atlanta.  
He's only that high because his contract is entirely frontloaded.  His average salary over the course of his contract is 'only' $12m.
That's probably highest paid in the MLS and not in the world.

Just allow everyone to dope. 

What's the big deal?

If these people wanna potentially rob their future selves of health in lieu of short term enhanced performance? I say go for it.  it's your body. 
Until people start dying on the track or the field and we have a pandemic of coaches forcing young athletes in their teens to dope early so they can get a chance to compete.

Think about it for a minute. Let's say you have a young child, 13 or 14, and they're a talented sprinter. Their coach tells them that they have to start using PEDs.

You're now telling a young child either they cannot compete at the level they want or they have to sacrifice their health for the rest of their life for 10 years of competition.
You are being absolutely retarded.  SJW type thinking. 


On what fucking planet is that a good idea?  Adults only obviously, don't be silly 
If you're ignorant enough to believe doping only happens among adult athletes then you're daft. 

If you remove all restrictions on PEDs then you're going to have people pushing their bodies to the absolute limit. People will die when they do that. Don't be foolish.
To believe doping only happens among adults *is* retarded. 


I know parents try and give their kids an edge. THAT should be illegal the kids cannot give informed consent. 

For an adult to dope? IDGAF.   For a grown ass adult to weigh the options and make a decision of whether to dope or not, that shouldn't be a problem.   
So here's the rub. Nobody is going to want to watch a sport where athletes are dying on the field or in training because of extreme use of doping. And if athletes are dying in the course of playing their sport then the sponsorship money will dry up because companies won't want to take the risk. No sponsorship money, no funding, no sport.",2016-06-20 12:47:20,http://sports.yahoo.com/news/alleged-doping-chinese-russian-swim-teams-investigated-113843498--spt.html
12,reddit,sports,sports sponsorship,Women in sports?,"Tomorrow I am doing a live chat with the Association of Surfing Professionals on some big news for the women's world tour. I'm curious what Reddit sports has to say about women in professional sports.

How do you think they can change their image for the better (if they even can change their image).

Do you think women compete at the same level as men? 

Why do you think they don't get paid the same for sponsorships? 

Share any/all thoughts, I'd love to share them in the [live chat!](http://www.latimes.com/sports/sportsnow/la-sh-women-surfing-lower-trestles-live-chat-20140210,0,4437801.story#axzz2syIatz1f) 
I know most people think this but they won't say it.   Women's sports are nowhere near the level of excitement and entertainment as men's sports.   It's essentially a slower and softer version.   And I actually *watch* women's sports.... but it's not the same thing.  

That said I think it's awesome for more women to get involved in athletics.
> Why do you think they don't get paid the same for sponsorships?

Less viewers is the main reason. For instance [Ellyse Perry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellyse_Perry) has represented Australia in *both* football and cricket. If a man were able to do that they would be earning millions in sponsorship, but because there's less viewers of women's cricket and football, there's less money from TV rights, less name recognition, less money.

> Do you think women compete at the same level as men?

Yes/No. None of the women in the 100m at London 2012 would have made it to the men's final, but they're still in the fastest ~60 people in the world, which is an amazing achievement. I'd like to see more combined competitions, yes the split won't be 50/50, but the best women could be competitive in a men's league and it could only train them to be better players.

> How do you think they can change their image for the better (if they even can change their image).

More women competing in the same competitions/leagues as the men like [Danica Patrick](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danica_Patrick) would challenge people's view that women participants are all at a ""lower level"" or division to the men. It would also expose female competitors to higher TV ratings, increasing their name recognition and sponsorship value.

in high school, the williams sisters were beaten by then world no 203 in tennis 6-1 and 6-2 after they claimed they could be any man ranked outside the top 200. males are, in general, more athletic, faster, and hit harder. these attributes make for exciting sport. women are, in general, sexier, and that is often how marketing goes. sharapova doesnt make a lot of money because she is good at tennis, she makes a lot of money because she is sexy. skill level is equal across sexes, in my general opinion, but why watch two matches of equal skills where one is faster and harder than the other? perhaps the answer lies in marketing womens sport using both performance attributes and sexiness attributes? the ANZ Championship did that with netball here in Australia - showed women in short, tight dresses hitting each other on the netball court. my understanding is that league is a success (mind you its also a sport not traditionally played by males). just my two cents.
Most of what I would want to say has already been written, but I want to say that there are some women's sports that are interesting to watch to see how female teams adapt to not being as quick or strong as the boys. 

Women's basketball and rugby come to mind as games that become much more team oriented- focused on passing, smart play, and quick decisions more than brute strength or speed.
Sure, TV ratings and highlights won't be as great for these types of games. But I, and many other veterans of the sports, enjoy seeing these differences and especially enjoy seeing other players learn to love the sport like we do. 
> Women's sports are nowhere near the level of excitement and entertainment as men's sports.

For the most part, I agree, though there are exceptions. I think women's pro cycling is actually more exciting than men's cycling, tennis as well, though that's swinging back lately. Sports like swimming, the various disciplines of athletics, skiing, and biathlon are pretty much equal. Gymnastics is only a little bit behind, as are judo and jiu-jitsu. But in plenty of other sports (primarily those that require displays of power and explosiveness), I'd say you're right.

For the OP:

* I don't really know how they can change their image. I'm not a marketing guy, so I'm not sure what can be done.
* No, in pretty much any sport, the women cannot compete at the same level as the men. The physiological differences are just too great to overcome.
* Women don't get the same money as men because there isn't the same return on investment for the sponsors. The audience is, unfortunately, too small to make it pay off.
>That said I think it's awesome for more women to get involved in athletics.

Agreed. Most of us will never become very good at sports anyway. It's great having more women around who like sports.
I love the story...

13,reddit,sports,sports sponsorship,What are the differences between the American sports culture and the European sports culture?,"Some I can think of:


1) Running up the score - This is seen as negative in America, while not in Europe.

2) Commercials and sponsorship - Americans have no problem with having many commercials in their sport broadcast but are vehemently opposed to having sponsor logos on the team jersey. Europeans are the inverse of this, unable to stand any commercials during the playtime, but having no problems with having corporate logos on team jerseys. Jerseys are seen as sacred ground not to be defiled by corporate interest in America, while not in Europe with teams signing the highest bidder for the team jersey.

3) Game presentation - Americans love to make a sport event into an entertainment production that aims to impress, with halftime shows, tons of splashy graphics, giant robots, planes flying overhead...etc, where the hype comes as a professional production. European broadcasts are much more straight forward and lack the production values and shine of their American counterparts.

4) European sports are based on Capitalism, American sports are based on Socialism - Somewhat ironic since in general society, this tends to be the inverse of what the two cultures believe. Yet American sports are overwhelmingly socialistic and egalitarian, with revenue sharing,  no relegation, drafts, even more drafts where the weakest teams get the best draft players, salary caps...etc. European sports on the other hand are pure market capitalism, with players bough and sold with huge transfer prices between teams, weak teams getting brutally punished by being kicked out into a lower division, while strong teams in lower divisions get promoted and domination of the superrich teams over smaller poorer teams. As such American teams tend to much more competitive across the league, with no truly superpower teams and weaklings that exist in European sports.

5) Franchises vs. Clubs - In the US, teams are franchises that can be bought and moved to a different city. This would never work in Europe. In the US, teams are seen as business entities that don't really represent anything, any social group or class. In Europe, teams generally represent a very specific slice of society and assumptions are made about you based on what team you follow. There is not much that differentiates fans of different American sports teams. This tend to create a much less hostile atmosphere and much more love shared between opposing team fans.

6) Fan culture - Obvious differences here, European sports fans are much more involved in cheering for their team, they sing, jump, bring banners, flags, scarves with team logos, do group choreographies...etc, while American sports fans don't. There is a bleak imitation of this in American college sports, although nothing even remotely close to the Ultras that exist in Europe. Many Americans who travel to Europe and go to a rivalry soccer game are blow away by the atmosphere and then pretend to be soccer fans once they come back to America, the inverse is not true for Europeans who come and see the best American sports have to offer. On a positive note, there is much less machoness and violence among American sports fans, with fights being much more rare. American sports events tend to be much more family affairs, which is refreshing to many Europeans who visit. 

7) Cheerleaders - A huge part of every American sport, these are slowly entering into the European sports culture due to the obvious appeal of having young hot chicks dancing. 

8) Travelling fans - Fans tend to travel in great numbers to opposing grounds in Europe, not so much in America. This could be due to the shorter distances.

9) Statistical objective view of sports vs. subjective view of sports - This is perhaps the biggest reason the two sides can't seem to enjoy the other sides sports, European sports tend to be freeflowing and impossible to describe with simple percentages or statistics, while American sports tend to be reductionist, broken down into measurable plays which can be standardized and therefore compared statistically. Listening to European sports fans you will hear very little in the way of numbers, but much more in qualitative prose, with people debating which player has the best ""touch"", most ""creativity"" and ""best vision""....etc. American debates on sports tend to be much more objective and based on quantitative analysis. American sports commentators will mostly talk in numbers, while European sports commentators will mostly will talk in the flow of the game. 

10) Multi-competition focus vs. Single competition focus - American sports generally have one championship and all American sports very much are dominated by the American leagues (ex. NFL is literally the only pro football league on the planet that matters, MLB and NBA are by a large margin the biggest leagues in their respective sports). European sports, in particularly soccer, have several leagues that compete with each other and even several championships within leagues that can be won by a team. As such a team can win several titles in the season, while American teams are limited to one title, often referred to as a ""World Championship"", a misnomer technically but perhaps correct given that they probably are the best in their sport. This however also presents a problem to the athletes, if there is a lockout for example in the NFL, the athletes are really screwed because there isn't another league in another country that they can play in and make same level of salary and play in front of packed stadiums on a high level. If say the Premier League closed tommorow, players could go into one of the several multi-billion dollar leagues like the Serie A or Liga or Bundesliga and still play on a high level with similar salaries.

edit: I just realized it sound like I'm saying the US sports culture is better, but I'm not, just that they are different and interesting to note these differences.

14,reddit,sports,sports sponsorship,An open letter to Richard Childress,"First off, congratulations on your grandsons championship in the Nationwide series. It's extremely difficult to come out on top after a long season. Your grandsons performance this year shows that he has what it takes, and deserves to be in the Sprint Cup series. My main concern is what comes next. What bothers me is the talk I'm hearing that you may put him in a car with the number 3 on it. I understand that it's your number and you can do with it as you please, I would just like you to consider the negative aspects of putting that number back on the track in Nascars top series. Really, there's so many, I don't know where to start. It pretty much boils down to respect. No matter how you go about it, many fans are just never going to be OK seeing the three car on the track without it's former driver behind the wheel. Sure, a lot of fans won't care one way or the other, but there are still fans who would be upset enough to adopt an ""anyone but Dillion"" attitude. In this sponsorship driven sport, I can't see why a team would alienate any demographic, much less fans as passionate as #3 fans. One only has to look at the unquestioning loyalty they show the #88 car to understand that they are not like other race fans. Another thing to consider is why would you put the added pressure of living up to the history of that number on a rookie cup driver? Just saying you won't put unreasonable expectations on him, doesn't mean they won't be there, they will. Probably just as important is why would you not want him to be his own man? He's already going to have detractors saying he was handed a ride because of who he is, not what he's done. Oh, he won the Nationwide title? ""Yeah, that was handed to him"". I know it won't be fair to think that, but think that they will. I could go on and on about why I think this is a bad idea, but mainly, I'm a sr. fan, and it was painful to see the #3 on the track without the Intimidator behind the wheel. I watch a lot more cup racing than nationwide, which would mean a lot more sadness on Sundays.   RIP#3

15,reddit,sports,sports sponsorship,Some things to keep in mind during tonight's George Steinbrenner Memorial All-Star Game,"(It may be in bad taste to criticize someone who has just passed, but having listened earlier to Dave Winfield describe George Steinbrenner as a ""good friend"" with a ""big heart"" and Joe Buck call him ""one of the greatest businessmen of the last fifty years,"" and knowing such ridiculous statements will continue throughout tonight's game, I feel compelled to offer The Case Against Steinbrenner:)


- In 1980, Steinbrenner made Dave Winfield the highest-paid player in baseball with a 10-year, $23 million contract, that included a $300,000 donation to Winfield's charity. After the Yankees lost the 1981 World Series, partly due to a disappointing performance from Winfield, Steinbrenner refused to pay the $300,000, and Winfield threatened to sue. Steinbrenner then paid $40,000 to Howie Spira, a publicist for Winfield's foundation with $100,000 in gambling debt, to dig up dirt on Winfield. When he failed, Steinbrenner called the FBI and had Spira arrested for extortion. He spent 22 months in prison and now lives on disability checks. For his role in the case, Steinbrenner was banned from baseball for life. When you are as wealthy and well-connected as George Steinbrenner, ""for life"" means ""for three years"".


- It's a stretch to say George Steinbrenner singlehandedly commercialized the sport of baseball. But not much of one. After declaring ""I am dead set against free agency. It can ruin baseball."" in 1973, Steinbrenner offered Catfish Hunter baseball's first multimillion dollar contract just a year later in a move that is universally regarded as the beginning of the era of skyrocketing player contracts. He aggressively pursued big-name players throughout the 70s and 80s, and publicly stated that ""you measure the value of a ballplayer by how many fannies he puts in the seats."" He fished out new sources of revenue, becoming the first owner to sell cable television rights, to MSG Network, and when MSG refused to pay a increased fee, Steinbrenner used his millions to create YES. When Major League Baseball blocked a $100 million merchandising deal that the Yankees signed with Adidas in 1997, Steinbrenner responded by literally *suing the rest of baseball*. He won.


- ""Sure,"" you say, ""but that's all just good business."" Mmm...sort of. In the 80s and 90s, the Yankees [averaged just a few million dollars in annual profit](http://www.businessweek.com/1998/39/b3597106.htm), even with the massive television contracts and sponsorship deals. The reason? Player salaries kept soaring, probably even beyond Steinbrenner's expectations. Clubs across the country were forced to increase ticket, concession, and merchandise prices to match the exorbitant salary demands of players--which were so high precisely because of the wildfire started by Steinbrenner's sensational signing of Catfish Hunter in 1974. The Yankees, a franchise worth nearly two billion dollars, have no problem with this, but there are plenty of clubs and fans across the country that do.


- ""Well, yes,"" you say, ""but whatever his methods were, and however sound his business decisions were, he had an undeniable record of success."" Mmm...sort of. With big signings like Reggie Jackson and Catfish Hunter in the mid-70s, they made it to three World Series in a row and won it in '77 and '78. But after that, the Yankees had one of the least successful stretches in their history--**the championship drought from 1978 to 1996 remains the longest in Yankees history**--and until being banned from baseball in 1990, this was the heart of the Steinbrenner Micromanagement Era, in which he made terrible personnel decisions like trades for John Mayberry and Ed Whitson, hired eight different managers (11, if you count Lou Piniella twice and Billy Martin three times) and earned the nickname ""Manager George."" Frustrated with the lack of success in the 80s, he publicly blamed and berated his players, including calling Winfield ""Mr. May""--which thanks to owners like Dan Gilbert may not seem so shocking today, but was pretty unprecedented in 1985, especially for someone who so emphasized professionalism and a businesslike approach to sports. The Yankees remarkable success in the late 90s came only after Steinbrenner took a much more hands-off approach and turned the reins over to GM Gene Michael, who had a much different team-building philosophy. Rather than trading away prospects for big-name veterans as Steinbrenner had done throughout the 80s, Michael cultivated talent like Derek Jeter, Jorge Posada, Andy Pettitte, and Mariano Rivera, who would go on to be the core of the team that won three World Series in a row. In his 36-year tenure, George Steinbrenner was a *hands-on owner*, and he was a *successful owner*, but he was never both.

tl;dr  **If you're not a Yankees fan, there's not much to like about George Steinbrenner. If you *are* a Yankees fan, there's not much to thank him for, other than signing checks.**

This idiot contradicts himself almost immediately. I originally felt bad for him for getting caught up in the dumb chants and politics but you lose that sympathy entirely when you try to print that shit on your race car. Now he's trying to have it both ways lmao, if you are going to be a political stooge at least don't be a coward about it
The fact that his name is Brandon . . .you'd think they'd have an easier time putting let's go Brandon on his stuff instead of getting sponsored by some random shit coin
> I have no interest in leading some political fight. I race cars. I am not going to endorse anyone, and I am certainly not going to tell anyone how to vote.

> ***But I'm also no longer going to be silent about the situation I find myself in, and why millions of Americans are chanting my name. I hear them, even if Washington does not.***


Brandon is a fucking idiot.
I bet all those people who ""just wanted to keep politics out of sports"" when it's BLM protests are gonna have something to say about this all of a sudden.

Edit: since it's locked I need to reply here: I'm not against either lol. Athletes have a right to use their platform.
One of his previous sponsors had this to say:

For Immediate Release:  Press Release regarding Brandon Brown and NASCAR

For those of you who don’t know me, my name is Vic Reynolds I am the Co-Founder and Vice president of the Original Larry’s Hard Lemonade Brewing Company.
Recently, there has been a lot of news regarding Brandonbilt Motorsports.  Unfortunately, as of late, the news has been negative.  I’d like to address this.
First, I’d like to say Brandon Brown is an incredible human being and the Original Larry’s Hard Lemonade Brewing Company has enjoyed a 3-year relationship with his race team.  

On October 2nd at Talladega Super Speedway, Brandon Brown won his first race in the number 68 Original Larry’s Hard Lemonade Chevrolet. The race was an extremely important win for Brandon, the Original Larry’s Hard Lemonade Brewing Company, and all the hard-working small businesses who have supported him for the last few years. 

Unfortunately, the win was overshadowed politically and instead of becoming a time of celebration, I believe it became a season of pressure for Brandonbilt Motor Sports.  Unfortunately, the pressure may have put Brandon’s race team in a position where mistakes may have been made in choosing a new sponsor instead of sticking with the companies that got him to victory lane.  And for this reason, I don’t blame Brandon.  I truly believe in my heart that if he had the opportunity, he would be with us and this would be a different announcement.

A wise man once told me that all money is not good money.  Over the years I’ve learned that you don’t have to be blood to be family. 
 
The Original Larry’s Hard Lemonade Brewing Company will continue to build upon its long-standing relationship with NASCAR.  With regards to Brandon Brown, he will always be my brother.
Controversial phrase? Does anybody care?
I would like to add in to this that NASCAR told them back in November that anything with LGB would not be approved. They had sent in a request back near Christmas saying that it was simply “a cryptocurrency”. Nothing else. They tried to play the system, got busted, and are now facing the consequences for their actions

Edit: Lol you salty, salty people. Get a grip on yourselves and quit acting like a bunch of children. My two year old niece is more mature than you all.
When you're so fucking lame, not even NASCAR wants you.

Cormier and I wrestled in the same weight class my senior year in high school (he was a junior). We never met in a match, but we always got close. He was always the #1 seed and I was #3 (I could never beat #2). 

One tournament, I was warming up next to the mat where he was destroying some poor guy. The match stopped for a minute (probably something medical) and he walked up to me and got nose-to-nose and said, ""get off my mat."" 

I froze...apologized and started to walk off. 

He said, ""naw man! I'm just messin' with you! When you gonna beat (#2) so we can meet in the finals?"" I  said, ""I'm hoping to this time.""

I didn't. And we never wrestled each other. 

But watching him in high school was like watching a man among boys. It was incredible. He threw guys all over the mat - even #2. He embarrassed people. But he was a very humble, good sportsman. 

Great guy. 


For non-MMA fans Daniel Cormier used to fight at heavyweight for majority of his career.
Gotta respect Gus for not grabbing the fence. Most refs would've just given him a warning, and he could've saved himself some serious trouble there. This kind of self-control makes you reconsider the possibility of other fighters just doing it out instinct.
That was so close to a fucking sweet Hurricanrana

42,reddit,sports,sponsorship,St. Paul Companies Are Spending Their Tax Breaks on Super Bowl Sponsorships. Teachers Are Crying Foul.,"
This story really has nothing to do with the super bowl, they just highlighted that to get attention. And it worked! Take away every tax break they get and they'd still have to advertise
St paul schools cant even get their kids home when it snows why should they get more money? As it is right now they get the 2nd most per pupil spending in the state and their schools are a shit house.

Poorer school districts in the state do far more with far less per pupil spending including getting kids home before midnight when it snows.

They dont need more money, they need less administration and superintendent pay. The Administrators are bleeding that district dry while students and teachers get fucked.
Superbowl cities are usually required to give tax breaks on NFL tickets and events.

http://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2014/02/20/nfl-wants-tax-breaks-for-minneapolis-super-bowl-bid/

 So teachers/government employees are on the verge of a strike while corporations and/or their customers don't have to pay the usual routine taxes.
What’s your point?  If the city didn’t offer the tax breaks, it wouldn’t be hosting the Super Bowl, how would that be better for the teachers?
The point does hosting a Super Bowl really benefit the host city. Maybe if they collected the tax they normally do there would be more money for teachers, fire, police etc. I've lived in cities with mega events and year round resident usually gets screwed over with little economic gain. The taxes never went down. And for what-a show/game? Tax breaks at a mega event like the Super Bowl are corporate charity.
> Maybe if they collected the tax they normally do

They will collect more tax than they normally do.

>I've lived in cities with mega events and year round resident usually gets screwed over with little economic gain.

It’s still a gain.

>The taxes never went down.

What do you mean?

>And for what-a show/game? Tax breaks at a mega event like the Super Bowl are corporate charity.

For an economic boost to the area.  Tax breaks for the NFL aren’t a charity, they are a negotiating tactic.  Cities are willing to offer it, because they are making more than usual even after the tax breaks.
If they are giving tax exemptions to NFL events among other things the state and local governments will see none  of that. The only additional tax might be quarterly or yearly income for some of the businesses. Alot of local businesses lose due to security and traffic policies during mega events. Sometimes that's 2-3 weeks of little or no business. That's also 2-3 weeks that someone's life will altered if they live near or in the area/major road. The NFL has asked for other charity including no hotel room tax, that's about 500 rooms not being taxed, probably higher priced rooms at that. Alot of businesses go to many of these same cities on regular basis without all the pampering the NFL requires.


> If they are giving tax exemptions to NFL events among other things the state and local governments will see very little of that.

Little of what?  If they events weren’t being held state and local governments would see nothing.

>The only additional tax might be quarterly or yearly income for some of the businesses.

There will be additional tax revenue. 

> Alot of local businesses lose due to security and traffic policies during mega events. Sometimes that's 2-3 weeks of little or no business.

What businesses lose?  

>The NFL has asked for other charity including no hotel room tax, that's about 500 rooms not being taxed, probably higher priced rooms at that.

It’s not charity, in exchange for not taxing those rooms, the Super Bowl will fill all the other rooms at significantly inflated prices.

>Alot of businesses go to many of these same cities on regular basis without all the pandering the NFL does.

If they brought in as much revenue as the NFL does, they would get the same concessions.

> This would mean the projected lost revenue for the IAAF over the next four years will be more than $30m. It is not clear yet whether the IAAF will attempt to challenge the decision in court, although lawyers within Adidas are understood to be preparing for such a move.

> Coe succeeded Diack in August last year and has come under pressure over Pound&#039;s report, which said the IAAF - of which Coe was one of four vice-presidents under Diack for seven years - must have been aware of the corruption.

Some of the details unveiled in this report were just jaw-dropping. For example, an FSB employee detailed to the lab under the cover as a sewage worker; or altering clean urine samples with salt to change the specific gravity to match the doped samples.
The American free market system of doping, in which the athletes choose and pay for their own PEDs independently, is clearly superior to the Russian centrally-controlled doping program. 
I'm Canadian and listened to the press conference in Toronto as it aired.  I feel bad for the Russian athletes who were probably coerced by their government to do this or get kicked-out of their sport.  Now they'll probably get kicked-out anyway.

If anybody deserves that, it’s Tiger Woods obviously. That being said, it’s kind of hilarious that this was an initiative approved by the Policy Board, of which Tiger is a member.

I’m sure he knows exactly why they want him there (ratings), but I’d think at a certain point it’s a little embarrassing for him to show up and do so poorly.

Good. Tiger should be able to play in whatever tournament he decides to show up for. Golf is better with Tiger playing.

Lets hope some German companies reward this ballsy move with a new sponsor deal!
This is some Ted lasso shit… telling a sponsor to fuck off who is doing some dirty shit. I like it, they should put out a go fund me, guaranteed, they’d make up the diff after this.
I hope this opens up other avenues for them to secure the bag. Schalke out here being the good guys.
A rare PR win for my depressing club.
It sounds like Gazprom would have a hard time getting money to the club anyway right?
Good guy Schalke 04 indeed, but the risk is not as extreme as they’ve let on here. Somebody, undoubtedly, will pick them up.
And that my friends, is called integrity
Schalke really out here trying to speedrun going defunct. Good on them, but wow that takes some serious guts. 

Of course, if I had the money this is exactly the type of move that would get my attention as a possible sponsor, so it may work out.

Well said Gary.
AFC Richmond, here I come.
Massive Liverpool supporter. Absolutely hate this with every fiber of my being. I am done with the club if it goes through.
He's 100% correct
can someone explain like im 5 what hes talking about? Im unfamiliar with football politics and policies but this dude seems so passionate about it im interested
The fundamental structure of English and world football is that teams can reach the top through winning. If that's no longer possible then what's the point of even competing any more?
I don’t think anyone has considered the quality of the product. When the big teams play each other it’s almost always stunted football, less risky. The football will be worse and the matches won’t mean as much. Such a shit idea
This really breaks my heart. Football wasn't meant to be this. Fuck FSG ,Glazers, Oil Mansour and Kroenke and yes,FUCK you too Daniel Levy. All along it was Perez and that Agnelli. Refused to pay his factory workers and now this. Kudos to Bayern and PSG for refusing the invitation and showing the better pathway to these money hungry uncles.
I as an Aussie supporter MUFC would not support this club if they go ahead with this league.

Multinational Companies are actively and unabashedly investing in China despite Olympic sponsorship
They’re certainly more at blame than the athletes. It always amazes me that people say athletes should forgo the fuck ton of money they could get from sponsorships because said company uses slave labor. Or they should drop their potentially one chance at competing in the olympics because of China’s atrocities.

I feel like the IOC deserves some criticism here too.
Not saying this is a correct view but after you spend hundreds of millions if not billions of dollars I would hesitate to cancel the event as well.
the majority has not wanted the olympics since their bid began as far as i’m aware
If nobody shows up we can give ourselves a bunch of gold medals
""Won't listen"" and ""Won't do what I want"" are easily conflated!
>	The weekend survey by the Asahi Shimbun daily found 43% of respondents want the Games cancelled, and 40% want a further postponement.

Slightly misleading headline.
With the absolute failure at their government getting japanese people vaccinated, I'm not surprised.
This reflects more poorly on the IOC imo than the Japanese government. They got the host country by the balls in unprecedented situations like this. If the Japanese government decided to cancel, they will owe the IOC billions and billions of dollars in compensation of the airing rights they had for the games, on top of the billions spent on infrastructure. It’s an unwinnable situation.

**Super Detailed Explanation of the Rules**

**Team Structure and Subs**

Each team has 18 men on the field, and 4 subs with some emergency players. We sub about 90 times during a game on each team. So 180 substitutions total by both teams. 90 substitutions is the cap. It used to be pretty much unlimited.

**Umpires**

There are 9 umps in pro footy. 3 are field umps, 2 are goal umps and 4 are sideline umps. There is no seniority if a ump makes a call and then another objects to the call then the last call made is the call. 

**Scoring**

If the ball is kicked between the middle taller uprights it is worth 6 points and called a goal. If it is between the taller uprights and smaller ones on the side it is called a behind and worth 1 point.

**Ball up after a goal (bounce)**

If the ball is kicked for a behind the team that conceded the point gets to kick the able out from the square between the goal posts. If it is a goal the ball is brought to the middle and a ruck happens. This is a jump ball similar to basketball. You elect 1 person in each team and they are known as your ruckman(normally tallest players on the field) and they tap it to surrounding players. This is also how each quarter starts.

**Moving the Ball**

You can only kick and handball the ball. A handball is where you punch the ball with a fist to another player. If you do anything else it is a free kick (mark) to the other team. You can however tap the ball along the ground, or tap the ball down towards the ground. However if you tap the ball up it is a penalty.

**Rule Violations and Marks (Free kicks)**

When a rule violation occurs in AFL, it always results in a mark. Which is where a person on team A stands at a spot while person on team B gets a run up to kick the ball unimpeded. If anyone on team A crosses the invisible boundary, the mark, team A gets a 50m penalty and team B gets to have mark up the field by 50m  in the directions of their goal.

The goal of the rules is to make the game free flowing so if you have opportunity to dispose of the ball and are tackled that is a penalty. Deliberately bringing the ball out of bounds is also a penalty. If you tuck the ball under you and curl around it, it is also a penalty. If you run 15m+ without bouncing the ball on the ground it is a penalty. If you hold a man who does not have the ball, it is a penalty.

If the ball goes out of bound unintentionally it is a ball up. This is where the sideline ump faces the stands and throws the ball up back towards the field. This is essentially a jump ball. It is a penalty if your teams elected ruckman(person doing the jump ball) is not the one who touches it first.

**Game Length**

A football game is traditionally 20m quarters. However due to current issues, the quarter length is 16m. However if the a stoppage occurs, ball goes out of bounds, ball is thrown up, etc. Then the clock stops. Which means most quarters go for 30m+.

**Field Size**

As long as the field is more than about 130m long from goal to goal and is an oval than it’s good to go. 

The lines at either end that curve around indicate 50m to the goal and is pretty much the range for most pro footy players. While in goal kicking range you can hold your mark for 30 seconds which is more than the normal 5-10 seconds or so that you normally get. So it’s sometimes used as a time wasting method.

**Tackling**

Pretty much if player A is holding the ball you can bear hug him to the ground. If you reach over his shoulder to tackle him, it’s a high tackle and a penalty. 

If you tackle him from behind and land on his back, it’s a push in the back and a penalty. 

If you tackle below the knees, it’s tripping and a penalty. 

If player A isn’t holding the ball and you tackle him then Player A gets a free kick. 

A dangerous tackle is normally when a player picks up player A and drops them on their head and that is a penalty and normally results in a post match fine.

If during a tackle you make no attempt to dispose of the ball, it automatically is a free kick for the opposing player.

If you sling tackle in junior football, so grab their arm and use that as leverage to throw them in the ground that’s a penalty but I don’t think that applies in AFL or at least I’ve never heard that call made in pro footy.

**More Rules**

A newish rule is that each team has to have 6 players in each third of the field when the ball is thrown up. It is a penalty if you don’t. We refer to the thirds as forwards, backs, and mids. There are actual positions but I won’t explain that in this post. Unless asked.

There is a square in the middle third of the field right before the ball is bounced(ball up) only 4 people from each team can be in the square. If there is more it is a penalty, there is no penalty for having less.

**Stoppage/ Ball Up**

Sometimes the ball gets stuck in an area with players grabbing the ball only to either lose it or get tackled with no opportunity to get rid of the ball. If this happens to return flow to the game a ball up happens.

**Difference between Ball Up and a Bounce**

A small difference between when a ball gets stuck and ball up occurs vs the ball being bounced after a goal. Is that pretty much how I described, the ball is thrown after stoppage while the ankle is bounced at halfway when there is a goal or it is the start of a quarter. If the bounce fails a ball up occurs.

**Yep More Rules**

Another rule is if the ball is kicked out of bounds on the full by team A then it is a team B free kick from the boundary at the spot where the balk was kicked out.

If the ball is kicked and hits the taller uprights that is worth 1 point. If the ball hits the smaller uprights, it is out on the full.

**Red Cards???**

AFL has no red cards, and no card system. All penalties are dished after the game by a match review penalty. With the harshest penalty ever being given to Andrew Gaff after a king hit on Andrew Brayshaw. IIRC it was for 8 rounds.

**When is the Ball considered Out?**

Also the ball is considered out if the whole ball goes out of bounds. There’s no rule regarding a player holding the ball stepping out of bounds meaning the ball is out of bounds. This means you see weird plays with players holding the ball in front of them to keep it in play.

**Look I was tired but here are more rules**

If the ball is caught and then punched out it is up to the umps discretion to give the mark. Also if both players are grabbing it nullifies so no penalty. If you block a person and don’t attempt to catch the football it is also a penalty.

Also a tackle that is above your shoulders is regarded as high and is also a penalty. Tackles below your knee are considered tripping and are also a penalty.

**Verbiage**

Not a rule but useful verbiage. A specky is a spectacular mark and normally called out when a player jumps on another player to make a mark. And yes it is completely legal to jump on a players back and use them as spring board.

If you want any other information explained or clarified just ask! :)

Edit:

It’s almost 1 and I’m tuckered so if something doesn’t make any sense just tell me and I’ll try to clarify with my tuckered brain. But this should cover most rules and instances you’ll see in a football game.

Edit 2: included tackling and field dimensions

Great game plan by Kotoeko. Tochinoshin can’t use his grip if he circles into it, and since his lateral movement is shot with his knees, he is essentially safe as long as he turns.
To be honest that's the only way to win when you are that size against this behemoth 😂 hoping Ichinojo finally wins this season losing a lot of weight really helped him alot
What's the ring made of? Is that dirt or concrete with dirt on it?
I was on a train to Osaka a few years ago when I learned the tournament the next day was in Osaka and not Tokyo. So I stood in line and got the cheap tickets... it was one of the coolest things I've ever seen, and I'm not generally much of a sports fan.
Sumo and rugby are the best sports I don't pay attention to.
The video I took this from: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uu\_i-xz\_ScM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uu_i-xz_ScM)

&#x200B;

A few fun bouts today so the video is worth checking out. The tournament is quite exciting so far, since we have a surprising leader after 6 of 15 days in Ichinojo, a man, who we all thought would be the big next thing around 6 years ago, which never happened (some say because he got TOO BIG body wise). Can he finally fullfill his´destiny and use his full potential? (Sounds like an anime :D )

Kotoeko is one of my favorite sumo wrestlers, so this one was quite enjoyable for me. Had quite the rough landing, though, but he seemed somewhat ok afterwards, in the parts cut.
I’m fascinated by this sport. Is there any YouTube channels that can educate me on the latest happenings in sumo and how to understand the game
sorry im not into Sumo who won now? the guy who was half out of the ring first or the guy who feel out of it?
(Former LHSAA Folkstyle wrestler here (admittedly, 20 years ago))... I've watched a few of these matches and know the basics of the rules.  But there are times that I curious as to why they don't sometimes throw a Russian Armbar and lead in to a trip or use a head snap.  This one is one that I would think would have worked.

After the run where she fell right before the finish, this was an incredible redemption race.
Femke Bol flicked her afterburner switch. She is superhuman.
Absolutely amazing.  Brown started great but she looked gassed in that final stretch.  Meanwhile Bol kept in striking distance and turned on the jets to clinch it.

There should be a minimum cultural standard for countries to host a World Cup or Olympics, and this should be below that standard.
This is what happens when you validate people with shitty opinions. Why hold back your hateful bile if there’s no consequence for spewing it?

No. Killing 6,000 people so you can plan a game, on the other hand…

90,reddit,sports,sponsor,Ellie Smart battling the wind at Red Bull Cliff Diving,"
I have done a lot of Rock climbing and it’s crazy how much wind can get in your head
Love how she recognizes the fear and finds a way through it.
I knew Ellie growing up - crazy to see her on Reddit and elsewhere nowadays, but pumped for her success. She was always super kind and humble.
This is what being a professional is about. It's managing yourself and the circumstances around you, the wind, the people, the expectations, the internal anxiety. Managing it all, taking the time you need for yourself to re center, and re-center, again and again keeping your composure and then delivering.

Truly impressive 💦
Its crazy how divers can be scared and still do it. My fear would have me holding on to the railing the entire time
I feel like those dudes in the water were way too close even if they are the rescue team
That was my initial thought, but they're probably 10 feet away from the landing zone.  Gravity and wind aren't going to make that much of a difference. 

I'm mostly assuming the experts and insurance companies know what they're doing here.

[Solo is married to former American football player Jerramy Stevens. They have been together since mid-August 2012 when Solo returned from the Olympics. On November 12, 2012, Stevens was arrested on investigation of assault following an altercation that left Solo injured. The following day, Stevens was released after a judge determined there was not enough evidence to hold him. The pair were wed the next day, November 13, 2012.]

To be fair, the Visine Dog Shit Dilbert Bowl turned out to be a riveting spectacle.
It reminded me of when The Onion did a segment on when the NCAA tournament expanded to [4,096 teams.](http://www.onionsportsnetwork.com/video/ncaa-expands-march-madness-to-include-4096-teams,14317/)
I've always wanted to see the worst two teams play in something like the ""Quik Cash Payday Loans Consolation Bowl""!
Bowls are so ridiculous now. They fit so perfectly into our participation ribbon upbringing though.
Are we in a college bowl bubble? What will be the aftereffects of it bursting? Will the US taxpayer have to bail out ESPN?
Who else was expecting a Youporn bowl?
I watched SNL for the first time in over 9000 years, last night, and really dug that they had _multiple_ sports-referencing sketches.

Mocking ESPN would've been pretty fun, too, but that might be a li'l too niche.
That was great, if someone didn't know better, the Taxslayer bowl could easily be in the fake category.
IIRC, you can blame the Fiesta Bowl for all the title sponsors (though I'm sure someone else would have thought of it).  They brought on Sunkist as their initial title sponsor.  NBC, who broadcast the games at that time, refused to mention the Sunkist name in the promos and broadcast for the first year or two.  Having that extra money enabled the Fiesta Bowl to outbid the Citrus Bowl for the Miami-Penn State matchup and it wasn't too long before other bowls started adding title sponsors.

Cool. Now ban their athletes.

This is still a joke.  If Russia is banned, why are athletes allowed to compete as “neutrals”?  If the athletes want to compete, let them move to another country and denounce everything that Russia and Putin are doing.  Anything short of that is politics as usual, and sport needs to be free of politics.

“Unknowingly ingested” 😭
I knew IOC was corrupt as hell, seems like WADA is compromised as well now. 

Local anti-doping labs were always sketchy, as we have seen with Russia (and presumably/ very highly likely China) being “doping labs” rather than preventing it. 

Well, “clean” sports was an illusion anyway.
Wasn’t it swimming that got Russia a few years ago? Or was it running?
Strip them of all swimming related medals.
I also like to keep crimes that are committed secret between me and the family of those committing crimes.

I'm not in a position to offer up money, but I'm putting in $5 anyway.  I'm sure I'll survive just fine without it.  Good luck, Kris!
I was paralyzed last year.  The equipment that paralyzed people need to stay fit is stupid-expensive.  The FES bike to keep your leg muscles from atrophying, a simple device, is like $16,000.  The other option is to find a therapist with the latest equipment, and they'll charge you about 2-3k/mo. for a membership.  Nothing like financial ruin to complement your ruined life.

100,reddit,sports,sponsor,Glenn Maxwell takes one of the best cricket catches ever,"
If r/sports has a cricket post you know it's going to be epic!
Mirror: https://youtu.be/S0tRZn_czKs?si=lkQdi_65ddhR-Ysw
For anyone who doesn't realise, if he lands on the ground outside of that ring while touching the ball it would have been 6 runs and the batsman would have not been out. I've seen similar a few times where the catcher will throw it back to another player standing by, but throwing it back to yourself like this is rare, and the timing was particularly perfect. Definitely one of the best catches I've seen.
I get why he isn't in the national Test team but Maxy at his best is beautiful. I hope he makes it to the T20 World Cup next year because the thought of Maxy leading Australia to victory against India in both World Cup formats in India within a few years is very arousing.
Nice, but he two handed the final catch.  /s
For clarity please - this works because he launches himself from _inside_ the rope, catching and releasing the ball before hits the ground _outside_ the rope.

For the final catch he first steps inside the rope before catching it - is that necessary or could he have launched from outside the rope and it still be out?
The incredible body control to literally windmill the ball while hovering in the air THEN get back in is unbelievable.

THEN add in that he has recently come back from a hamstring tear, is 36yrs old and definitely in the twilight of his career, and this was a giant moment for a star studded team that has lost 5 in a row and is rooted to the bottom of the table after huge missteps?

Yeah this was magical...
I hope this gets the traction it deserves, it’s truly one of the best boundary catches.
Americans truly are one of a kind. Apologies for generalising, but they’re presented with an amazing clip from a sport that they’re not aware of, but basically the rest of the world is, and they’re more perplexed by the grammar around the word “Take”.

[deleted]
Nope, that is not true. Government can’t interfere in running of the local governing body. Even that is not black and white. Government sponsoring a team will not be a problem at all.

Also, people aren’t celebrating because the team is state sponsored. They are celebrating because the government was surely going to exploit any success. Happens in every country to some extent. Sports success creates goodwill for the government. Iranian government was going to actively try to gain goodwill out of it.

Finally the players themselves have made statements supporting the protests. They are with the people. In first match they even refused to sing the national anthem.
FIFA has allowed Iran to get away with pretty much everything. For example for years the Iranian regime didn’t allow women to get into stadiums and even today when they do it’s very limited and disrespectful and only when a FIFA or AFC rep is present. FIFA doesn’t care they rather sweep everything under the rug. Just look at how dismissive they were about issues with Qatar hosting!

JORDAN: “…and I took that personally.”
NASCAR is privately owned and the teams are effectively contract employees.  There are lots of similarities to the NCAA and college athletes 10 yers ago.  

MJ has enough money and business savvy that he doesn’t have to bend over and take it from NASCAR.  MJ may be the engine that fundamentally changes NASCAR.

Nascar will have to he careful because if other teams see MJ standing up for his team and it's rights, the other owners can join him and then Nascar has a problem.

There is tiny demand for baseball in Brazil and it isn't even in the Olympics. What's the big deal? Surely that space could be used for something more useful...

Pretty curious seeing a bunch of Americans getting mad over Brazilians losing something they don't want.

edit: nevermind just realized they weren't authorized to do it.
There is a reason there is only one baseball field in all of Brazil yet endless thousands of basketball, volleyball, soccer, tennis... etc fields. 

It'd simply because baseball isn't even remotely popular in Brazil. It's not even in the top 25 sports. This isn't some conspiracy or the bank trying to crush baseball, it's simply a lack of demand and an unused field that was build by American expats who are no longer playing there. The field is basically empty and in ruins, since nobody wants to play baseball in Brazil. Why not convert it into something that would actually be used? It's like if the only kabbadi field in America got destroyed. 
It's not like anyone outside of the US cares about baseball either. So not sure I'd call it particularly newsworthy.
[deleted]
There's only 2 Americans out of about 50 people I know who play there. That's including myself. Baseball was in the Olympics in ~~2012~~ 2008. You have no idea what Brazilians want. 
Because baseball is one of the less popular sports in baseball, it's OK for a half a trillion dollar to destroy public property without permission from the government? Out of about 50 different people I've met using the field, only two have been American or Canadian.  With the exception of a few Latinos, everyone else is Brazilian.  I never said there was a conspiracy against baseball.  It's as simple as a large corporation caring more about marketing and money than the community. This is also a corporation who had stated they sponsor the Olympics in effort to invest in and encourage sports.  The field is actually being used, multiple times a week. You make a lot of assumptions regarding baseball here that you know nothing about. 
That's some special kind of stupid.

I’ve just discovered what the world most boring voice is
Imagine losing 4 billion dollars because somebody moved 2 bottoms 4 feet to the left…out of camera view
The ironic thing is this has really just given coca cola more publicity
I don't understand humans. So just because that soccer player didn't want to promote that drink (should be obvious that elite athletes don't dump high fructose corn syrup into their system) then millions of people all decide to stop drinking it immediately? I don't understand. Are humans really this pliable?
Just be aware that coca cola paid out their investors dividend on the same day. As that's one of the most tangible ways a company can ""lose value"" (they pay out 4B$ - their value should be 4B$ less) stock markets usually adjust to this very precisely. As it seems they did on the same day. There is a small discrepancy, obviously, but that is within the range of day-to-day market fluctuations.

At least that is how it was explained to me some days ago. Maybe just this time the market didn't want to adjust, and only saw the image damage due to Ronaldo.
Their market value dropped by like $4 billion

Nah, this is just some investors playing silly games.  They look for any excuse to legally influence a stock/share price.
Marketing for global brands works differently from small brands. The point of a small brand doing something like this is to introduce you to the product, and get you to think along the lines you describe (they use it so I should look into it too). For global brands the point of this advertising is to remind you periodically that the brand exists, so that when someone says “soda” you think “Coke” as opposed to “Pepsi”. Removing the bottle from the shot means that when short clips of his answers are replayed that logo won’t be there as a reminder. 

And to answer your last question, yes. This kind of marketing really does work. If I say to you “Name any fast food restaurant.”  What’s the first thing that pops into your head? Whatever you think of wasn’t random, you picked that brand because of this kind of marketing.",2021-06-17 16:04:31,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvYkPG3kYVU

That's fine *for you*. You, personally, play no role in the LGBT community seeking out equal rights and protections under the law, and for them to fundraise money, for example, to displaced teens. I mean, you *could* play a role and volunteer, but it doesn't sound like you'd want to.

Just to be clear, it's not about you, but their cause and plight means a lot to many people.
What rights do gays not have that straights have?  

Displaced teens are displaced teens.  What they do sexually makes their plight more deserving?

126,reddit,sports,sports partnership,[META] On the Qatar slavery trend,"*I guess that I'll get downvoted to oblivion (a friend referred to this as a hara-karma) for speaking against the ""dominant"" perspective on Qatari worker rights issues, but hey let's try that.*

Well, it's been about a day since the Qatar-denounciation trend launched. I can't say that I'm favourable to the current human rights situation of Qatar, but in my opinion it is a huge double standard that's dominating this subreddit.

So, let's begin with the post that began all of that, the [Coke](http://i.imgur.com/6WHbsFa.png) one. You know, I guess, that Coke is also responsible for [environmental destruction](http://www.theguardian.com/money/2006/mar/19/business.india1) in a lot of countries, and still, people are more shocked about the fact that they give money to a country that uses slave workers than about the ""regular"" shit they do.

Let's move on Adidas. Let's say that they cancel their World Cup sponsorship. Guess what? They'll still have a metric fuckton of [slaves](http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/apr/14/olympics-adidas-clothing-sweatshops) to make *your* clothes.

And now for the organisation that organises this tournament: FIFA. They established special courts for the [2010 South Africa World Cup](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/21/sports/soccer/21iht-wcsoccer.html) and pressured Brazil, Russia and Qatar into dropping their restrictions on alcohol consumption for the [2014, 2018 and 2022 World Cups](http://www.latinpost.com/articles/15443/20140623/fifa-world-cup-sponsors-budweiser-partnership-changing-alcohol-bans-brazil.htm).

What really annoys me is that western countries and companies exploit people on the other side of the world pretty much every day to sustain what you call *high standard of living*, and that FIFA has been an awful organisation for a while now. But suddenly, it's about Qatar, so everybody can talk shit on the 2022 World Cup. The 2018 World Cup is to be held in Russia, and so were the Sochi Olympic Games, but apparently conducting military operations on foreign soil, rigging elections and doing a lot of other awful stuff is better than a worker a day dying.

In my opinion, we are simply witnessing the First World attacking a non-First World country based on its ethical standards, standards that we don't even respect ourselves. It simply shows how easy it is to forget deaths happening thousands of kilometres away from you to produce *your* shit and to think that we are nonetheless countries with high moral and ethical standards.

**Tl;Dr** If Qatar stopped using slave workers, that'd be great, but it's just hypocritical to attack the sponsors about the World Cup while Coke, Adidas, etc... have had awful human rights and environmental records for years while nobody seemed to give a shit about it before.

---

*Addentum*

Note that I am in no way condoning Qatar's use of slave workers at all, however it seems that this topic is subject to a dangerous double standard, with Qatar and the sponsors getting all the shit and, in the meantime, other issues that have been here for far longer are not being discussed. Coke and Adidas aren't going to be less of two slave-owning, earth-poisoning companies if they retract their sponsorship (as I already said).

Keep in mind where the TV contracts are. ESPN has no incentive to broadcast hockey at all. They are all in on basketball. It’s slowly becoming the NBA Network. 
They don't cover Formula One and they are the US broadcaster of the races.  So yeah unless its the top 3 sports in the states you get nothing.
That, and, they are just a terrible sports news network.
If it isn't LeBron, the Skankees, or the NE Bradys then ESPN doesn't cover it. You might want to tune into the NHL Network for Golden Knights coverage.

130,reddit,sports,partnership,"Indianapolis Indians will not change team name, announce partnership with local tribe","
Despite what the name might imply, the Indians are the Triple-A affiliate team of the Pittsburgh Pirates
Sounds good. The triple-A Spokane Indians  did the same thing and it is hugely successful. The uniforms and fan gear are in the native Salish language and it’s awesome.
Listen, I’m all for making changes that don’t portray real cultures negatively - it would just be really hard for me to not question a name change when they play in Indianapolis (the city of Indians) Indiana (the land of Indians).
I was born in Indiana and am half East Indian

My original birth certificate had Fathers Ethnicity listed as 'East Indianian' 🤣
Indiana means “Land of Indians” so I think it’s fitting but maybe a bit bias as a Hoosier native
In fairness the word Indians isn't the word Redskins.
I thought this would’ve been cool when the the commanders were looking for a name. Partner with a great tribe and change the name to match. Share a percentage of revenue with them and promote the culture and traditions at games. Real Indian tribes are badass and have really awesome cultures that can be celebrated and appreciated. 

(Could’ve also done the same thing with the guardians)
Eastern Michigan used to be known as the Hurons in honor of the Huron tribe.  They were never disrespectful about it...and the Huron chief had no issue with it.

Eastern Michigan changed their name to the Eagles anyway and missed an opportunity to work with the Huron tribe.

I think there's a good way to honor Native Americans with team names/logos so long as they aren't outright offensive (looking at you Washington and Cleveland).  Working with a local tribe and giving them a cut of revenue?  That would be amazing.
I worked for Native American Government and went through the cultural training.

Every Native is different. Some love teams called Indians, some love being called Indians.

Some hate it, most are indifferent.

It's all based on the individual. Getting the support of a local tribe is a great way to solve the issue.
For the uninitiated among you, the term ""Indian"" becomes much more accepted the closer you live to an actual reservation. Most of the aversion to the term really comes from guilty (or well-intentioned) white people.

Kanye is nuts so they’re rightfully taking a stand and making an example.

Do you think Kirkland Signature has a chance at signing him?

Isn’t Nike basically out of golf anyways? Their gear was shit.
Nike proceeds to chase him down their driveway.
Changing his name to ""Puma Woods"" for a new brand partnership.
His longest partnership. Ah well. Nothing lasts forever.
I'm going to assume they'll create their own golf apparel and equipment companies. Especially since his kid is now coming up.
Years ago when I worked at Nike my districts Ekin told me, right after Nike had dropped a tennis player for bad behavior, that despite all the mischief Tiger had gotten into with his wife that Phil Knight would never drop Tiger. He said the reason for that was Tiger was the only athlete that called Phil and wished him condolences after his son died from SCUBA diving. 

That makes me think this was either Tiger’s choice, or it was decided mutually.

Wow
College football is in shambles. Just make it a minor NFL league at this point.
[deleted]
They get zero benefit of a conference in the playoffs. They are ineligible for a bye, they always have to be an at-large.

The only postseason benefit They get from the ACC is in the non playoff bowl structure, and at that point....who cares. ND taking Virginia's spot in the Pinstripe Bowl isn't changing anything. 


MORE teams need to be independents. We're all hiding behind shitty conference schedules and it's just killing the ability to actually put an interesting, competitive product on TV.
What benefits are they getting?
The days of ND being independent in football are numbered, that’s just reality. But when that day comes they won’t join the ACC (if it still exists), it will be the Big Ten. Why aren’t they just in the Big Ten now? Over a hundred years of bad blood that eventually needs to be water under the bridge, but isn’t yet. When the ACC arrangement was first signed I don’t know any ND fans who were overly excited, but they got to get a sweetheart deal because the ACC needed them more than they needed the ACC 🤷🏻‍♂️
I’ll do you one better. Clemson needs to leave their conference or advocate to remove the championship game. There is no point in conference championships now with the 12 team playoff system in place.
They aren’t in the big ten now because they would lose money compared to their NBC deal
That hasn’t been true for a while before this latest Big Ten tv deal was signed (for the full member payout schools in the tv deal). Schools like Indiana will be getting $30-40 mil per year above what ND gets from NBC…Now saying that no one at ND should be screaming poor, but the decision they made by staying independent was to leave money on the table in their tv deal for the market share of all your home games being nationally televised and the attention that comes with",2025-05-06 18:30:49,https://sports.yahoo.com/college-football/breaking-news/article/sources-notre-dame-clemson-agree-on-12-year-college-football-scheduling-partnership-131810870.html

Yes
Keep in mind where the TV contracts are. ESPN has no incentive to broadcast hockey at all. They are all in on basketball. It’s slowly becoming the NBA Network. 
They don't cover Formula One and they are the US broadcaster of the races.  So yeah unless its the top 3 sports in the states you get nothing.
That, and, they are just a terrible sports news network.
If it isn't LeBron, the Skankees, or the NE Bradys then ESPN doesn't cover it. You might want to tune into the NHL Network for Golden Knights coverage. 
The joke is their name stands for Eastern Sports Programming Network.  
I am a west coast sports fan but lived on the east coast for years.  I'd watch sportscenter before bed and when I woke up. It felt like such a dearth of any west coast coverage. From mlb to college football.
If you need ESPN to follow a sports team you are doing it wrong.

This is so huge. MLS held out for what they wanted and they got it. This will mean more MLS and soccer coverage on major networks than ever before. Fuck yes.
[deleted]
This MLS TV deal is huge for Fox and ESPN and Univision 
Any confirmation on the money? I saw 70mil in comments but no sourcing.  
  
I'm excited, it's frustrating to find games most if the time.
When you consider that you couldn't even watch the World Cup on mainstream American television back in 1990 and that the MLS didn't even exist then, it just goes to show you from how little it all started just 24 years ago.

When it comes to these things, we really need to think of it in generational terms, we're talking about a cultural shift that doesn't happen in a few years, it happens over generations. 

Good news for the MLS and its no wonder so many smart investors are putting money into it, it has more potential than any other league to grow in the US. 
I wish it included broadcast Fox rather than Fox Sports or FS1. As well as ABC along with ESPN. I think Univision is the real winner, being able to reach OTA viewers.
$75mil a year from Fox and ESPN combined and another $15mil from Univision. $90mil a year total, up 500% over the last deal which paid $18mil a year....

Would it be possible for the media to request an FOIA request since UT is a public university or are private deals protected from public scrutiny?
Notre Dame also has its own licensing arm and takes an additional amount on every piece sold. They've got their own hologram sticker for the tag and everything.
I'm not sure private contracts apply to FOIA.

161,reddit,sports,partnership,"The Chicago Bulls pressing for Wade, LeBron partnership","
The last line of the article is precious gold: 

>Sources say that James is dubious his mere presence on the Knicks will be worth that much more to him in endorsements. The appearance of Knicks GM Donnie Walsh in a wheelchair due to a neck problem and the frumpy, unimpressive Jim Dolan didn’t provide James with an image of vibrancy.
I feel like getting Bosh to go with either player would be the better package for any team.  Although Wade is clearly a superior talent to Bosh his skill set and style of play is too similar to Lebron's for any team to get true value out of them playing together.  Don't get me wrong, it'd still be a monster combo, but you'd get some serious friction when two alpha dogs who have spent their entire careers carrying their teams enter into a tight 4th quarter.  

I also think that the drop off between a truly great center and an average one is a bigger dropoff than a truly great guard and an average one, particularly if you're already playing with one stud at that position.
Wake me up when one of them signs, I've had a couple lifetimes worth of speculation just this offseason.
Yes Wade loves Chicago but they can be together in Miami with nicer weather and also have Chris Bosh on the team. They can try to create a dynasty there.

Nothing they could do in Chicago could ever surpass the Jordan era.
as a person who has lived in both miami and chicago, miami's sports atmosphere is dominated by fair weathered and bandwagon fans.  no real athlete wants to be in that situation.
It may be a concern but it's not a top priority for James. He wants championships and he wants to be a billionaire and he'll sacrifice the quality of fan to achieve that.

He won't worry about Miami fans because LeBron considers the world to be his fan base and right now, the biggest fan base is China and in China, they don't buy LeBron jerseys, they buy Kobe jerseys because the Chinese don't respect hype, they respect championships.
Miami scenario:Gutted. Bosh-Wade-James with zero pro-caliber NBA players on the rest of the roster. The gutted team will be packed with more filler material than a hotdog.
With that triumvirate and Pat Riley, I'm sure they'll be able to persuade some decent talent to come on board, even if the additions have to take less money than they would like, for awhile.

I could also imagine Bosh-Wade-James agreeing to take less money themselves, in order to be able to lure another big player. The Holy Trinity will become a media sensation and their potential endorsement deals could dwarf any salary considerations, as with Tiger Woods and Jordan. I suspect that NJ pitched this same scenario in order to be able to try and snag all 3 of them.

I pity the team who gets Amare. He's not going to win anybody any rings.
another big player would be impossible....it would be octogenarians, and peewees. Chicago looks much more attractive. Better sports city. Better Team. Better fans. Bigger Market.

meanwhile i can't muster the willpower to study for a giant exam i have tomorrow
May be an unpopular opinion but it's incredibly foolish of her to continue and extremely irresponsible of official to allow her to continue.

Something similar is need for football too. Boycott the World Cup.
The US people don't have the will to try a grass-roots economic boycott, the US government doesn't have the will to try any kind of trade war.  So we'll fuck the athletes.
Different types of boycotts. A diplomatic boycott will mean we just do not send high level people to the Olympics and the Chinese will probably reciprocate. An economic boycott is much more serious and reciprocation can be devastating to both sides. An athletic boycott means our athletes won’t be able to attend. Consider how effective our 1980 boycott of Russia was over their Afghanistan invasion. About as pointless and ironic gesture as was ever made.
This is ridiculous. China is committing atrocities on a grand scale and it’s part of their plan going forward, if it was Iran or Congo we would boycott in a second since it’s absolutely the right thing to do. What’s this free pass we’re giving to China?
I feel like a boycott of the Olympics is a little bit of cutting off our own noses to spite our face. It won’t hurt China, but it will be a blow to our own athletes.

That's just... wow. I wold probably walk off the court.

Out of all those clips the only one I wanted to see was missing : ""Townsend dinged Huber in the back of the head with a forehand.""
At that point, why stop at just one? Hit the other two with the racket and call it a day. 
How fucking stupid is the 2 women's bench in the first gif? After she serves the ball onto the empty side, they jump up and applaud like she had just done the most difficult play. That's just insulting to the other single player.
What would be even stupider is if one player on each team got hurt.  When it's 2 on 1, you are almost certain to lose anyways, weird rules or not.    
    
But imagine the farce of a 1v1 game with doubles alleys, half the serves being non returnable, and half the service games being forfeited.

 Barkley elsewhere has said he'll consider.  From Barkley that isn't a coy way of saying he'll do it; it means he's not saying no before listening to what they have to say.

This is the guy who said about LIV golfers ""If somebody paid me 200 million, I'd kill a relative."" He was (probably) kidding, but maybe LIV took that as a sign, I don't know.

As for maybe having to leave TNT, that's just the Round Mound working out the possible consequences. It's all speculative prediction.  As some of you point out, it might just be putting out feelers to raise his own salary where he's at.
That's turribble
It’s amazing how many comments are talking about ESPN paying chuck more when he doesn’t work for ESPN and the literal title of the post says he works for tnt.

LIV for basketball?  Or is Barkley playing golf now?

Anyone who played badminton for fun know that it's very different than what you see on video. It seems like they have all the time in the world to reach the shuttlecock and it's easy, but in fact you are exhausted after 5 minutes. Really great game. And of course that's even quicker when they know how to play.
World record for fastest badminton shot is 493 KM/h. That should blow your mind. 
I like the guy in the blue shirt on the left. He is very interested in the match, begins to applaud when he thinks yellow scores a point and then enthusiastically applauds when black turns it around. I like it when people are excited about something.
More like goodminton am I right
Bruh, badminton is fun as shit to play. I feel like such a bad ass because I can hit the shuttle really hard and stuff. I guess it's not very fun to watch though, considering how less popular it is than tennis as a spectator sport.

They really tried so hard.  I really liked watching to my surprise.  My sister more or less made me.  I don't know much about it, and couldn't seriously judge the difference between the top 3.  The funny thing was that I had no interest to begin with and didn't plan to watch any of it, but my sister went to bed early for work and I ended up staying up by myself at her house and watching the whole thing alone in the dark.  The whole thing was entertaining in a eerie,  weird way I thought, but I'm not sure people were meant to really put themselves under that kind of pressure.  I kind of wish they could just sort of relax and enjoy themselves more.  But I guess that competition and pressure was also for them the time of their lives, so to speak - so there's that.

Anyway, as an American, I really wish them the best for their entire future lives.

Don't waste your time watching this garbage TMZ video...he beats on a punching bag, talks trash, hits the bag some more, and then spars with some bum, and you can't see anything happen anyways. You're welcome in advance.
 
No matter what you tell a Conor fan they are completely convinced, ""He is 28, he has a shot, Mayweather is old"".

Floyd Mayweather is 49-0 against boxers, he is the greatest defensive fighter of our time.  He knows how points work in the Boxing sport and out points you every single round.  

No matter what you put in front of an MMA/UFC fan, they just eat it up.

I suggest everyone watch the movie Great White Hype (1996) if you truly want to understand this fight.
That bum is probably better than McGregor at boxing lol
There's a link to macgregor's sparring that's worth a look, though. Looks clunky, like he doesn't know what he's doing, & slow. He's got a lot of work to do. 
I used the Great White Hype a couple days ago as very close example about this fight.  They're so similar in a lot of ways.  Except Mayweather doesn't have a beer belly and is still training.

To me, ESPN has basically become a glorified commercial for DK, with it taking over entire segments, infiltrating the tweets of many anchors and just basically revolving the entire brand around DK.

I hope ESPN is getting a lot of money out of this deal, because it has really tarnished them as an independent news source to me.  I'm actively looking at competitors for sports news.
ESPN is tarnishing its own brand... Stephen A Smith literally threatened Kevin Durant this morning. That's not journalism, that's hooliganism.
ESPN has been trash for a while.  Stephen A Smith should not be on tv or even have a job imo.  The constant draft kings commercials are annoying.  The only think I like anymore are the 30 for 30s.
For DraftKings to tarnish the ESPN brand, ESPN would have to put out something of value besides ATH, PTI, and Sportscenter.
there's not much shine left to tarnish
Enter promo code ""ABSOLUTELY"". 
Disney is being paid 250 million dollars by Draftkings. Let's not single out ESPN. FoxSports has an exclusive deal with FanDuel. 

Edit: 250 million, not 500.
I need Lebron James' opinion on this before I can answer.
I really hate SC now.  They change the left hand side lineup all the time just to keep you watching.  Sometimes they'll skip things in the lineup entirely.

235,reddit,sports,brand deal,Why is ESPN trying so hard to count WWE as a sport?,"Don't get me wrong, I grew up watching WWE and have ultimate respect for what those athletes do and put their bodies through. BUT calling it a ""sport"" is a far stretch. It's ""wrestling entertainment"". Everyone enjoys watching it and at this point, watch it more for the drama than the actual fights. It's basically a soap opera targetted to men and 14 under crowd.

Would you watch an NFL game if you knew Goodell had already decided who's going to win the game? Same with soccer, baseball, hockey etc? Even wrestling itself is a beautiful sport and we watch any sport because the outcome isn't determined. I get it, ever since Brock jumping to UFC, both industries have gotten a lot more attention. And WWE stars have started incorporating a lot more MMA disciplines into matches but at the same time, they already plan it all out for the most part.

Putting WWE into the same category and adding interviews and analysis over something those athletes already have rehearsed and predetermined seems redundant. It's like interviewing a soap opera actor as their character but selling it as a real interview, right?

Just want to reiterate the fact that I have great respect for all professional wrestlers/ wrestling entertainers and they are athletes by all means. But does sports entertainment need in depth interviews and analysis? Nope.

Just another point to add in the gradual decline of ESPN as it turns into a joke focusing more on sports ""entertainment"" than the sports analysis.

TLDR; WWE doesn't need sports analysis. ESPN is turning to a joke.
The answer is very simple.  The 1st letter in the acronym of ESPN is E which stands for 'Entertainment'.  WWE's last letter in it's Acronym is also E, which stands for 'Entertainment'.  Whether they like it or not, they are in the entertainment industry, and actually sync up in that regard.  For years, ESPN crapped on wrestling as not just being fake, but most of their anchors started calling it 'wrasslin' like they did in the south.  The truth about WWE, though, is that it is a global entertainment company that reaches out to over many genres and demographics.  The example that its's a 'Soap Opera for Men' truly is appropriate.  The 'superstars and divas' as WWE would like you to call them truly are incredible athletes, and many of them paved their way to the WWE through legitimate sports such as football, college wrestling, UFC and a the indy wrestling scene.  

WWE transcended the 'wrasslin' circles during the 'Attitude Era' and the 'Monday Night Wars' of late 90's and early 2000's.  WWE (or WWF as it was called back then) and WCW were pulling ratings not that far off of legitimate sports and while ratings are overall terrible right now, they are still higher than most professional sports outside of pro and college football on a weekly basis.  In other words, if there is a volume of audience, then there is money to be made from that audience.

Two things are happening.  WWE is losing ratings (as just mentioned), but ESPN is losing subscribers simultaneously and for different reasons.  WWE's product is weak right now, and thus they are looking to branch our their product to new markets.  ESPN is a HUGE market for WWE to be promoted on.  With the cross-over star athletes such as the Rock (Dwayne Johnson - currenly #1 action hero along with Robert Downey Junior in Hollywood, although the Rock is about 10 years younger, and in much better shape), Brock Lesner (both legit former UFC fighter and current WWE wrestler on a limited schedule), and even Ronda Rousey (hottest (mean that 2 ways) UFC fighter regardless if she has the belt or not) stopped by WWE's biggest event, Wrestlemania last year and got both WWE and ESPN buzzing.

So to finally get to your question, why does ESPN have interest in WWE?  Well, as stated, ESPN is losing subscribers.  They overpaid for so many college and pro sports broadcasting rights coupled with the fact that bundle package promotions are evolving such as Netflix, Amazon Prime, Google TV, and regular networks such as Fox, NBC and CBS now having their own 24 hour sports television, ESPN is losing viewership.  To combat that, they are opening up their audience to a wider range of demographics.  When the poker craze hit in the mid 2000's, it seemed every night ESPN showed poker.  Well that market is slowly waning, and they need to find something to keep viewership.  Why not bring in an already established, global brand like WWE that has cross-over potential to legit sports as well as Hollywood?!?  It almost seems like a mutual win-win for both companies.

The final thought is that WWE has evolved over the past decade.  No longer are they the PG-13 bordering on Mature content.  It is at best PG and mostly G nowadays.  Sure there is still violence, but there is no more blood, there is no more 'extreme' although they still want you to believe that, and there is no more sex and swearing.  WWE is catering to kids now.  ESPN has always been a PG network, and with it owned by Disney, a parent company that caters to kids, that is also a reason for a marriage between the two companies.

If John Brenkus wants to break down how Neville does his finisher splash off the top rope, the amount of athletic ability to do that is the same as those other examples they use with other sports.

Well, that is the long and short of it.
It's very odd that ESPN chooses to promote WWE when it is at a 20 year low in ratings on their flagship program (RAW).

It leads me to believe there is some kind of deal in place where WWE gets promo time in exchange ESPN will get something down the road (possibly the rights to one of their programs).


It makes me wonder if WWE has seen the writing on the wall with scripted fights not being able to compete with legitimate UFC fights.  It would take time to slowly incorporate MMA style into a scripted format, partner with ESPN to add legitimacy and recognition to your brand in the unscripted market, and then transition to an MMA brand that would rival UFC. 
ESPN used to air wrestling for years and still does sometimes on ESPN Classic, so ESPN and wrestling aren't a new couple.

WWE and ESPN have a deal and are working together. It benefits both parties, though it benefits WWE more.

Almost all of the internet wrestling community agrees that the deal isn't working though because they are pushing the scripted stuff in interviews/coverage on a channel that covers real sports. If they were legitimately covering real life wrestler personalities and real life on goings, we would be fine with it. Believe me, the non-scripted parts of WWE are very interesting and a lot of the athletes do have stories worth covering.
I feel that Fox Sports 1 is bringing more competition than they expected. Considering FS1 has the rights to UFC, this is all they have to offer.
TL;DR: ESPN sucks.
Totally agree. If you listen to Joe Rogan's podcast, he recently talked about how since UFC has no real sizable competition, they kinda have the autonomy to do whatever they want in terms of treatment of fighters and title opportunities etc. Strike force was the closest thing to a competition before they got bought out.
If WWE goes that route it would totally change the game. Granted, both companies treat their employees horribly but it would start a movement for the fighters to have an association with base salaries etc.
I would argue that the people who are attracted to UFC are not necessarily the main audience to WWE. they might be some intersection but they are entirely different audience.
The wrestler's personal lives are by far the most interesting part of it.  I stopped watching wrestling entertainment when I was 12.

236,reddit,sports,brand deal,8 Things Americans and Canadians Can Enjoy About Soccer/Association Football,"Although I am from Europe, I came to love sports as an American – I followed them all, particularly baseball where I became a die-hard fan.  After moving back to Europe and this past World Cup, however, I find myself totally enchanted by world soccer, AKA association football.  Following association football is like traveling to a foreign land of strange customs and unusual rituals.  Here are some of the good reasons you might want to check out the sport and some of the ways it differs from American sports:

**(1) Clubs (aka teams) are divided by how well they play rather than geographic divisions, or arbitrary leagues or conferences.**  Every county’s league has a top division where the best 16 or so teams play, usually two games a year each, one at home and one away.  If a club plays poorly for a stretch (depends on the country’s system as to whether it is one season of a combination of multiple), the team can be “[relegated]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promotion_and_relegation#North_America)” to a lower division.  This way, which clubs are playing in the equivalent of the “big leagues” can change year to year.  It’s as if a whole major league team can get sent down to the minors, and a whole minor league team gets called up to the majors.  Most of the major teams have been relegated at some point in their history.  Winning the league is a huge deal, however because of this system no playoffs or final games are necessary, whomever is in first place after the last game of the season wins it. It's not unusual for this not to be decided until the end of the day on the last day of the season to see who won and who lost.

**(2) The teams change their kits (aka uniforms) every year.** This probably seems like sacrilege to an American sports fan, but yes, every year the top teams change their kits.  The home kit is usually a variation on a similar theme with similar colors that change their exact shade, but the away kits can be absolutely anything – e.g. pink one season, black and gold the next, then red checkers the following year.  [Here](http://i745.photobucket.com/albums/xx92/MiamiPenya/image_17344.jpg) is an example of a old classic team, FC Barcelona, with the home and away kits over the years (home for each year on the left, away on the right). The whole deal with the kit and clubs is very different outside of the US and Canada, for the top teams the companies actually pay (and a lot) for the right to even make the kits and give them to the team.  They make their money back selling the authentic versions to the public.

**(3) The  starting XI (the starting line-up, first team players) often changes for every game, as does the positions of the players.**  The dynamism of this part of the strategy of football is pretty mind-boggling.   Often you won’t know until hours before the game who of the 25 stars on the team is even playing that day, in what formation, and in what position. The only exceptions to this are the goalkeepers, who do not change into “outfield players” or vice versa.  Although the coach is limited to 10 outfield players, this can mean any number of defenders, midfields, or forwards in any of a number of different strategic formations.  Fans love to speculate before a game what formation will be used and with what players.  This allows for players to rotate though and get rested by skipping all or part of a game, and allows the coach to strategize and tailor each of his starting XI to each of his opponents.

**(4) You never know exactly how long a game will be.**  Because the clock never stops during a game, whether it is for a foul, an injury, or a goal celebration, the referee will add “injury” time to the normal 90 minutes. The trick is, no one knows how much time this will be until the official time ends.  Many games have been decided in just the extra few minutes and players scramble hard to get ahead or a draw, while the leaders are defending like mad.

**(5) It is truly a global sport**.  Although the majority of the time the clubs are playing each other in their domestic leagues, during the season there are concurrent tournaments (and some that just take place over the summer) where the better teams from each country compete with each other as well.  The most prestigious of these is the Champions League tournament in Europe.  This way you get to see the best teams in England and France also play the best teams of Spain and Germany, for instance.   These games run throughout the regular season on the weekdays, while regular league play is usually on the weekends.  A good player will also be called up (or “capped”) to play for their national team as well, and these games also go throughout the regular season.  A good player on a good team will often be playing an absurd number of games week-in week-out for their regular league, Champions League, and national duty.  National team play also means that players from clubs that are bitter rivals become colleagues, as well as the reverse. An interesting example of this is one of the fiercest rivalries in national play is between the national teams of Brazil and Argentina.  The captains of those two teams, however, actually play on the same club and are the best of friends. In addition, the teams are an incredible mix of Africans, Europeans, and South Americans with the occasional smattering of Mexicans, Americans, Canadians, Australians, and people from Asia.

**(6) The fandom is global as well.**  Anyone who has traveled outside of the US and Canada, or hung out with people from Europe, South America, or Africa, know that football is global religion that Americans and Canadians are mostly left out of.   People from Africa are often just as loyal to their British Premiere League team as any Englishman, and there are just as many fans battling over Real Madrid versus Barcelona as there actually are in Spain.  Next time you see a photograph of just regular kids together from Africa or Israel, I can bet you at least one of them will be wearing a shirt from a club or national team.  Sure, people all over the world knew about Michael Jordan and still LeBron, but that has more to do with them being global brands as individuals.  These people genuinely follow these teams like their own.  Learn about association football and pretty much wherever you travel, you will have something to in common to discussion people.  Even Iceland is football crazy.

**(7) Good lord is it just fun to watch.**  The barrier to entry to understanding a football game is extremely low, maybe the lowest of any sport. There are subtle rules of course, the most obvious of these being the [offside rule]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offside_%28association_football%29), but you don’t need to know much about them to really enjoy the game.   It may take a lifetime to understand the nuances of strategy, the finer qualities of having the best ""touch,"" or when to use a double pivot, but you can get what is going on right out of the gate.  Compared to association football, NFL games probably look like chess and baseball looks like one of Feynman’s lectures on Quantum mechanics.  For football, you can just turn it on and enjoy it.  The theatrics are pretty great as well.  A come-from-behind goal will inspire flips and coordinated dances among the players; grown men will be jumping into each others arms in glee, hugging and kissing each other en masse.  And this happens almost every game.  For better or worse (worse I suppose, except for entertainment value) the game is also extremely physical and players often collide at running speeds that send a player shooting off like a javelin or rolling away like a tumble weed.  There is also the case of “diving” where players fake these big collisions to get fouls called against the other team.  It takes a bit to get accustomed to seeing players getting knocked down so much, but they usually only have the wind knocked out of them and get back into the game within a few minutes or even seconds.  

**(8) Last, and perhaps most importantly, the reason to start watching association football now is that it is in its golden age.**  Baseball fans, how much would you like to be able to go back to watch the games with Willie Mays or Joe DiMaggio in their prime? To see Sandy Kofax or Nolan Ryan pitch?  Well, that’s what’s going on now in Europe, and in every league.  There are so many players now who are close to, or probably are, the best that ever played the game, people don’t even know how to rank them.  And since practically every kid in nearly every soccer-playing country plays soccer, even the ones growing up in poverty and in the developing world can be found and nurtured to stardom.  And the virtuosity of these players is easy to appreciate and truly amazing. You will have stories to tel you grandkids in no time. These days, records that stood for decades are being broken every month, and often by players still in the middle of their career so there is no telling as to where the sport will go next.

As a American who got Mad World Cup fever, so much support for this post.  There is so much that soccer offers, wish it was more popular among my friends.

So if Cabrera earns some endorsement cash on top of his salary and invests everything wisely, he could someday own a club — ideally one built in his image.](http://ftw.usatoday.com/2014/03/miguel-cabrera-contract-detroit-median-income-tigers/)

That is a mind bending statistic to me, that one player could basically earn the value of an entire sports team. Isn't this indicative that there is something wrong with the way the economics of major league baseball are executed?

As a tigers fan I have no problem with this deal. This deal is about more than the 10 years Cabrera will play there. This deal is with a no doubt hall of famer to a franchise with some historic players, those of which that are still alive are constantly around the team, clubhouse, and fans. From a marketing standpoint Cabrera is money in the bank not only during his playing days but after they are done. Appearances, autographs, season ticket holder meetings, etc. I saw a guy buy an Al Kaline autographed jersey for $1,000 at spring training this year. Cabrera will live on as a tiger long after his playing days are done.  All of this for one of the best pure hitters ever? The price seems worth it, let alone the cost of inflation etc. Lastly, owner Mike Illitch is a guy who has more money than he knows what to do with and knows the value of a star to a franchise. He had no problem making Stevie Y the face of the franchise for the wings and no doubt he's doing the same with Cabrera. Not to mention that he may be rewarding Cabrera with some bonus money for being simply awesome and deserving of $30 mil a year for the last few years. 

Tl;DR Maybe a bad deal if you just look at money. But if you're someone who has money to blow and want to reward someone while building overall franchise and fan base value, doesn't seem so bad to me. 
Spot on. The money he will bring in and has already brought in easily covers the cost (this is similar to why Fielder could be signed to a ridiculous contract, fans already had a connection with him). Cabrera had his off-field problems he's seemed to sober up from, making it a pretty good investment. As we saw last year, it doesn't matter if he gets hurt during the season, he'll still play, and still be the best hitter the Tigers have. This also gives me some confidence that the Tigers aren't in ""we need to win now or else"" mode, and are looking to dissolve the team. They've locked down their two biggest stars for long contracts, though it would have been nice to lock up Scherzer too. 

But to answer the question posed, I don't really see how it's indicative of a problem with the economics of major league baseball. He's well on his way to becoming his own brand name, a la Michael Jordan, where it can be argued that Jordan's own brand at its peak was worth more than lesser NBA franchises. I'm not saying Cabrera is the Jordan of baseball, I'm just drawing an analogy how a single player's worth could be more than an entire franchise, especially if the franchise is run poorly or has poor support from its fanbase. It's also hard to disseminate how much Cabrera brings in to his own team, because he plays on a team that's been pretty decent since he's been joined. But, as the Triple Crown sell-out crowds in KC at the end of the 2012 season showed, Cabrera is a major draw on his own, for fans of baseball, not just fans of the Tigers. So that he would make enough money over the course of his career to be roughly equal to the immediate net value of a franchise isn't too surprising or inappropriate to me, I guess.

238,reddit,sports,brand deal,Real skiiers tune by themselfs,"Hey there fellow! Perhaps you equally travel sloping every single season? One who would undoubtedly suffer his / her personal life for the purpose of snowboarding? In that is the case, welcome to my own cabin! Now I am yet to help you to strengthen your snowboarding experiences significantly. Now let's talk about the # 1 guideline of skiing, at all times wax your own snow skis or board to lower your expenses and obtain a much better control in the ski slopes. In this manner your own snowboard enthusiasm will certainly improve very fast. The actual summary you get via waxing your very own snow skis and / or snowboard is that you won't get any unshaped edges which might of break your butt.



It is very few who knows the fact that close to virtually all waxing equipment works for both the snowboards as well as snow skis. I'm yet able to present you a full ski wax kit.

I actually snowboard lots in Revelstoke and as everyone are aware of the weather conditions there is quite drastically changing on daily basis, because of this having to deal with control of my very own waxing has made my skiing adventure far better. The hills in Fernie, Chamonix,Banff can usually get a little bit wet snowfall at some point and yet another day it's one meter powder, it is so extremely important to have your snowboard waxed in the correct way. In the present day, it does not affect me, since I simply take on the brand new wax, carry out some good waxing each and every morning and I am prepared to get going. Making use of 365 days guarantee and no best before dates, no matter if you do a 100 % season or even exclusively have a very few days to take in the ski slopes, a ski wax kit is a wonderful expenditure of money. The very qualified ski wax brands has even stated that regardless of just what tuning technologies that could appear the following quite a few years, it cannot become really greater than this goods out of this year. That being said in order to be good to everyone who enjoys you, be sure you shell out and share every one of your close friends a brand new skiing experience. The key reason why I'm reasoning to much with this is because I really like the one I committed to this time of the year. It has to some extent improved my entire life entirely. I am just intending to express a little more what I mean!



Suggestion number 1 is usually to possess wonderful organized tuning tools. There are tuning tune waxes for several conditions making it straightforward for people to ski at all times.

240,reddit,sports,brand deal,Breaking news: Chris Bosh and Dwyane Wade to miss the 2010-2011 season! ,"The Associated press reports:

The Miami Heat announced this morning that Chris Bosh & Dwyane Wade may miss the 2010 -2011 season when they were discovered early this morning dazed and confused with multiple leg fractures crawling along a drainage ditch adjacent to the New Jersey Turnpike.  In an unrelated matter, Lebron James announced that he will host a one hour special on ESPN next Thursday night at 9 ET entitled “What’s Next?” It will be broadcast live from the Prudential Center in Newark, New Jersey.  For those who can’t get to Newark, it will also be shown on a 500 foot Diamondvision that will be set up on the construction site of the Nets’ new arena in Brooklyn. 

In yet another odd companion story, Russian billionaire, Nikolai Prokhorov announced one of the biggest real estate deals in modern times with the revelation that he has purchased Akron, Ohio.  The mayor could not be reached for comment.  In fact, the mayor could not be reached at all. 

Coincidentally, the deputy mayor was found this morning floating face down in the Ohio River.  The governor immediately appointed a new deputy mayor, Svetlana Prokhorov.  When reached for comment, Ms. Prokhorov would only say, “I am da winnah”. 

Later this morning, the New Jersey Nets announced that tickets for the upcoming NBA season would go on sale sooner than had been expected——tomorrow.  Tickets can be purchased at the Prudential Center box office or by going online and visiting their brand new web site:  www.itaintovernyet.org

A bit of context : Toulouse is the european capital of Aerospace industry as well as rugby. The Stade Toulousain is the most decorated rugby club, owning 4 european cup trophy and have been 20 times France's champions. Thomas Pesquet, a huge fan of Rugby and the Stade Toulousain (you don't care but I got to meet him at a match once :D), he is extremely popular in France and this collaboration between ESA and this sports club is an interesting way to promote the space industry.

So this is a nice bit of trivia, some hidden design are done on this jersey, see the article translated below and more: 



**Translation of the article by deepl translate:** 

On Sunday, December 20th against Exeter, for the second day of the Champions Cup, the players of the Stade Toulousain will wear a jersey straight from space. Produced in collaboration with the European Space Agency (ESA) and Thomas Pesquet, this third outfit is a tribute to one of the city's specialties: space. And more particularly to the Proxima space mission, in which the French astronaut, a fan of the Stade Toulousain, took part.


A jersey covered with symbolic

The logo features four stars that refer to the European Cups won by the Stade Toulousain. The graphic design of the outfit is inspired by the astronauts' spacesuits. The jersey is also adorned with an X that pays tribute to Thomas Pesquet, the tenth Frenchman to have been in space. Other inscriptions, such as the number of experiments performed during the Proxima mission, appear on the outfit. Another originality of the jersey is that it includes a QR code that gives access to exclusive content when it is flashed.


[**Thomas Pesquet info on instagram:**](https://www.instagram.com/p/CIgjjnJBzfF/?utm_source=ig_embed)

A first for a space agency and a salute to the values of sports that were key to achieving my dream: Toulouse rugby club invited me to design their Champions Cup shirt this year! We added many details and graphical elements that refer to my first mission Proxima as well as the shared values rugby and spaceflight hold. With this jersey Toulouse is ready to conquer the stars and become European champion! I love the result but obviously I am biased, what do you think?

255,reddit,sports,endorsement,Crowd boos during singing of U.S. national anthem at [Ottawa] Senators game,"
I forget when it was, maybe last season, the singers mic stopped working during the American anthem in Calgary.  The crowd started singing the American anthem.
The only Senators to actually do something in response to Trump.
Can’t wait for the next Montreal home game 😊
This happened like 20 years ago during the Bush administration and the rest of Canada condemned Montreal for not having class. This time I think everyone’s response is pretty universally “yeah that seems about right.”
This isn't something Canadians do. Not all that long ago, at a hockey game in Canada, when the sound system failed during the *Star Spangled Banner,* the crowd took up the song and finished it a cappella, to the astonishment of Americans watching the game. *That's* the kind of thing Canadians do.  
But when the new US administration discusses annexing our sovereign country and, in one broad move, makes our exports to our biggest market unaffordable, I'm afraid even we may express our feelings of frustration impolitely. Even if nearly half the players in the NHL are Canadian.
You know you fucked up when you make Canadians rude.
As an American, I’m cool with this. Why should Canadians show us any respect with the way we are treating them right now?
The video itself is only like 6 seconds of booing the US National Anthem followed by 1:28 of cheering the Canadian National Anthem.
A total opposite from [this ](https://youtu.be/mHSaHRd4Q48?si=ktt7lsgTJvj70wBT). I'm saddened by the trajectory of this world.

For others out of the loop 

> The LIV Golf Tour is the name of the start-up tour that is attempting to compete with the PGA Tour. It was commonly referred to as the ""Saudi Golf League"" during its early days given that it is financially backed by Saudi Arabia. It will host eight events during its inaugural season…

- [Sporting News](https://www.sportingnews.com/us/amp/golf/news/liv-golf-tour-name-invitational-series-meaning-explained/ietdisstrdtxa8k3u2s5c5kq)
I think the real question is will you (the golf watchers of the world) actually watch?
Yeah I don’t think the golfers involved give a shit.  I mean they took the Saudi money.  I doubt they give a fuck about anything beyond that.
Correct me if I’m wrong, but all the players who joined LIV are still potentially eligible to compete in all four majors. This ban is for every other tournament and championship the PGA Tour operates
Phil Mickleson lost his KPMG sponsorship in February for calling the Saudis “Scary motherfuckers to deal with” four months later they pay him $200 million to play on their tour.

Phil played the long con and won.
Let’s be honest; this isn’t the PGA taking a moral high ground. This is the PGA trying to squish competition.
Phil Mickelson addressed it, the giant nihilistic cock:

""We know they killed Khashoggi and have a horrible record on human rights. They execute people over there for being gay,"" Mickelson said in February, taking one heck of a bizarre path in trying to justify his decision.  
  
""Knowing all of this, why would I even consider (participating)? Because this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to reshape how the PGA Tour operates,"" Mickelson continued. ""(The PGA has) been able to get by with manipulative, coercive, strong-arm tactics because we, the players, had no recourse.""
As a golf fan, the thing I am most interested to see is how the Official World Golf Rankings (""OWGR"") handles this. 

For those who don't know, the OWGR assigns points to players based on the competition of a given event and their finish in the event and that determines how a player is ranked globally. This world ranking is one of the methods to determine who automatically invited to three of the majors - the top 50 get into The Masters and The Open and the top 60 get into the US Open. There are other exceptions that are event-specific, like prior champions of The Masters are in automatically as well.

Given the LIV tour only has 8 events and the competition level is not where the PGA is, it's easy to see OWGR treating LIV like a lesser tour and it becoming extremely hard for players who don't already have exceptions from winning in the past making the majors. And an inability or unlikelihood of playing majors is what could keep a lot of players from jumping.
Also heard they locked out the golfers from LAF and LUV too",2022-06-09 14:00:25,https://www.espn.com/golf/story/_/id/34063037/pga-tour-suspends-all-players-taking-part-first-liv-golf-tournament

""Doesn't make enough money to live.""

Dang, just how much is she getting paid?

""221K a year.""

I don't know what crap you're spending money on if you're bleeding through 221K in less than a year.
I wish I could sustain a life on $220K.
It sucks to be arrested, and from an american perspective this is bogus…. But she’s not in America. It’s truly naive to expect special treatment in another country. The kremlin is no doubt enjoying this, but it was her mistake…
Her PR people and her WNBA coach are really making her case more unlikeable by the hour.

My favorite part was where they said “if this was Lebron, he’d be home already. This is statement that shows the undervaluing of black people and women.”

1. Lebron IS black.

2. There are US men who have been detained there for far longer than she has been.

3. I think it speaks to overvaluing of athletes if anything. I mean if a random redditor got imprisoned there, you probably wouldn’t ever even see a story about it. Yet here we are seeing stories constantly about her.
Weren’t Americans given plenty of warning to leave Russia pre invasion?
Why do some people think that their rights travel with them on a passport the moment they leave their home countries? That's a surefire way of fuck around and find out
“She doesn’t make enough money in the WNBA to support her life”.  
She gets paid 221K a year base salary.  Yeah ok. Bunch of privileged cry babies. Try working for peanuts doing something you hate every day just to support your family. Then you can talk.
I’d hate to be this person but trading any athlete for an arms dealer doesn’t seem like a fair trade. Especially after bringing drugs into another country.

I have a new appreciation for leg kicks since no crowds
I thought the ref was gonna end it sooner.
I forgot about those shoulder shots.
Live crowds were pretty cool
I remember watching this with my brother and friends and as soon as we all watched the shoulder smashing him over and over we all got up and started saying ""He's got him!"". Wild strategy that paid off big time. 

In fact excuse my ignorance if I'm totally wrong, but I feel like I haven't seen a whole lot of people even do the shoulder thing before. Wild to watch live.

People here need a reality check. College athletics are a ticket out for many. They simply don’t have the bandwidth to worry about the state politics of the school that at the least is giving them a free ride and an opportunity to play at the next level. Tbh this is tone deaf of the NAACP to even ask this.
This will have no impact on recruiting. most black kids won't even hear about it.

267,reddit,sports,endorsement,Katie Ledecky explains why she is passing up an estimated $5 million per year in endorsements,"
Ya, I don't know who's consulting her on this decision but they are not very bright. $5 million dollar endorsement opportunities are fleeting, while a college education is always available. If she gets injured in college and can never compete again, then what? 
I understand it's fun to compete in a team environment, but this seems extremely short sighted.  She could make up to $20 million during this Stanford detour and would have the freedom to do nearly anything she wants with her life upon retirement.  If she took the money she could still go to college there and train with the Stanford club team.  And she'd still be competing on the US National Team.

Most swimmers don't have longevity like Michael Phelps, especially females (see: Katie Hoff, Missy Franklin).  I really hope she's still competing at the same high level in 4 years, but you just never can be sure.
If she had developed a popular app no one would prevent her from profiting from her efforts. If she had written a best selling book or a top 40 pop tune or simply started her own basket weaving business and was making a profit no one would prevent her from enjoying the fruit of her successful labor. 

But because we have the fucking NCAA the thing she does best at the collegiate, national, and international level she must do for free because it happens to be an athletic endeavour. 

Fuck the NCAA.
She's doing it to be a part of a college team. Her family is already very well off and doesn't need the money. She wants the college experience. I commend her for making her skill not being about the money but about the experience itself.

Missy Franklin did the same thing and swam at Cal for two years iirc
She should receive about $115,000 from the US Olympic committee which the NCAA allows her to collect:

“An individual(prospective student-athlete or student-athlete) may accept funds that are administered by the U.S. Olympic Committee pursuant to its Operation Gold program.”
http://sports-law.blogspot.com/2012/08/why-missy-franklin-retains-her-ncaa.html


So not all money for performance is bad.  
Swimmer passes up $5 million just so she can have the NCAA experience, because she's wealthy and knows she can afford to do so. 
Cause she is dumb?
Not that money is an issue for her anyways with her family..

Tim Tebow has done more in the NFL than most people can say. The fact that people are always trying to bring his name down just shows how good he really is. Unfortunately I'm a lions fan but I was in Denver for Tebowmania and I hated hearing about it all the time but I'm not going to sit here and belittle the guy because I don't like what ESPN has to report about. Tim has always gone above and beyond to better himself and many of the people who are writing this negative carp about the guy should learn a thing or two from him in hopes that it will make them want to better themselves and the world around them. Again my argument is that Tim Tebow has done more in the NFL than a lot of players have in their entire careers. Calvin Johnson never won a post season game and he's going to go down as a hall of famer it's just proof to the fact that most people out there who hear about Tebow want to bring his name down because he's an outstanding athlete. Just like the LeBron haters out there. If people really get a kick out of bringing other people down bring down the people who deserve it like Manziel, Hardy, Rice, Smith, the people who are truly causing pain and suffering to other people not the once who are trying to change the world for the better

I am old enough to have seen Jerry Kramer in action on the gridiron; and there is no doubt in my mind, no doubt whatsoever, that he belongs in the NFL Hall of Fame. The fact that he has been nominated numerous times and has not, as of yet, been inducted to the Hall of Fame is an injustice. One that reflects poorly on the Hall of Fame; for if a player with Jerry's credentials hasn't made it in, then there is something wrong with the system. Something that needs to be rectified.    
Here is the address to the Hall of Fame Selection Committee. Jerry has been nominated 10 times, and is the only player from the NFL's greatest 50 players of the first 50 years not to be in the Hall.

Arguably, the one play that accounted for a huge amount of the Packers' success in the 60s was the ""Packer Sweep"". Kramer was the pulling-guard who made that happen.

Let's see. He's never been in any type of trouble with the law. He take a fan out on the town before every single game. He gives more than most of us will make in our life time to charity. He volunteers. He doesn't curse.

Yeah. I could see how he's a little marketable.
Well yeah, religious nutjobs practically portray him as Jesus.
Except for the part where he sucks at the thing he's supposed to be good at: completing passes
This is endorsements. They don't give a shit if you suck at sports as long as your marketable.

Come on, andhelostthem, get your head out of your ass.
I'm not quite sure why they think he's this widely marketable. Most sports fans know he sucks and, although he has name recognition, most people outside of sports can't recognize his face.

Please explain to me how Tim Tebow is more marketable than Shaq, Beckham or even Tom Brady because that's what this article is saying.
Easy. Brady is hated by everyone outside of Boston because he's so good on such a good team. Plus, for some reason that is unknown to me, everyone has decided he's a dick. 

Beckham isn't like because of the fact that he's British, he's married to a doll, and all of his tattoos (for serial. Older people do not trust people with a lot of tattoos)

Shaq doesn't even play basketball anymore. And people never really got over him leaving Orlando the way he did. 

Might I remind you that Tebow was fifth in jersey sales last year. First his rookie year, and his new jersey is already flying off the shelves.

It's uncommon, but people who do suck at their respective sport can market extremely well for a reason.

Tebow (Classic good looks, charisma, religion), Anna Kournikova (Really good looking), Danica Patrick (female in male dominated sport), and Manute Bol (Freakishly tall and African!) all come to mind.

I'm surprised that having a lack of scientific evidence actually stopped people from buying them.

I had an office mate try to sell me one of these, and showed how effective it was by standing on one of his legs, and arms outstretched.

He claims with the bracelet, he can easily maintain his posture.  He then removes the bracelet, and wobbling ensued.  

I walked out on him, laughing my ass off.
