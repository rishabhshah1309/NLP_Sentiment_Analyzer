1kk3myy,nba,"Draft Lottery is Tomorrow: Here are the predetermined ""fixes"" for each team","With the draft lottery tomorrow, the fans of teams who didn't make the post-season have their favourite year-end event: the draft lottery

Every time the draft lottery is held, we begin to hear suggestions that it was fixed/rigged, with proof! What proof will there be this year? Below are all potential proofs lottery conspiracy theorists may come up with for why Flagg was always destined to go to the lottery winners.

**Utah Jazz**: White.

**Washington Wizards**  - On October 21st, 2024 Wizards owner Ted Leonsis suddenly announced he had entered an agreement to keep the Wizards in DC, ending chatter about a move to Virginia. Agreement promised a new stadium renovation, and that the team could not consider relocation until 2045. Why the sudden change from Leonsis? He must've been promised the rights to Cooper Flagg of course. Not to mention someone named Flagg playing for the nation's capital? Too obvious.

**Charlotte Hornets**: LaMelo is one of the most popular young players in the league, leading the East backcourt in All-Star votes. Play seems rather obvious here. Pair him with Flagg and you've given Gen Z its team. Plus, the Hornets were sold in summer 2023. New ownership didn’t care about the shitty 2024 draft though, so the league must’ve promised them the #1 pick in 2025 of course.

**New Orleans Pelicans**: We saw how much attention the Pelicans and Zion got when he was a rookie. He needs a partner in crime. Who better than another 'generational' Duke prospect in Flagg?

**Philadelphia 76ers**: Philly is a massive market, with one of the most talked-about superstars in the league in Joel Embiid. The franchise is on life support right now, and the NBA doesn't want to lose out - giving them Flagg would fix this.  

**Brooklyn Nets**: The Nets reside in the biggest market in the league, yet they haven't quite shed the Knicks' little brother label. Giving them Flagg could change things.

**Toronto Raptors**: With the lottery being rigged every year, the NBA needs to throw in curveballs here and there to throw fans off the scent. Can’t rig it every year, it’d be too obvious. Give Flagg to the Raptors to accomplish this.

**San Antonio Spurs**: The league wants Wemby to be the face of the league, and he can’t be the face of the league with a middling roster. Give him another stud to pair with Fox and let the ratings flow in.

**Houston Rockets (PHX unprotected pick)**: Houston is a *huge* market on the brink of a dynasty. We just saw how great they performed in the playoffs. Adding Flagg to that high-flying (and Sengun) core is guaranteed ratings, and also ensures a great environment for Flagg to grow and develop into the modern American superstar the NBA needs. Combine that with the built-in China market from Yao, and a successful franchise in Houston would only be a positive for the league.

**Portland Trail Blazers**: Portland refused to tank this year, going on a meaningless run at the end of the season. NBA wants to send a message to the likes of Utah and Washington that tanking won’t help, so they give Flagg to Portland.

**Dallas Mavericks**: Self explanatory. We all know what’s going on here…

**Chicago Bulls**: Chicago is an absolutely massive market that’s been struggling. The NBA is simply a better place when Chicago is good. Easy decision to send Flagg here

**Sacramento Kings**: The Kings just months ago sent their franchise player, De’Aaron Fox, to the Spurs to play with Wemby, and received a pittance in return. Why would they do that??? Well with Wemby being the next face of the league, the NBA desperately needed a star next to him. After being promised Flagg, the Kings acquiesced and gave Fox for next to nothing, because Flagg was the real prize.. 

**Atlanta Hawks**: #1 overall pick back to back years? Psh, yeah, right. Obviously rigged, just like the Cavs in 2013 and 2014 was rigged too.",2267,0.95,557.0,1746977311.0,2025-05-11 08:28:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1kk3myy/draft_lottery_is_tomorrow_here_are_the/,stadium naming,post,,

1kzd2zd,nfl,Defunct Team Spotlight: Pottsville Maroons,"Today the NFL we know is made up of 32 teams from medium and large cities from across the nation, but few remember the landscape of the NFL 100 years ago. Instead of teams playing in cities like Los Angeles, Seattle, Houston or Miami, you had teams popping up in places like Rock Island, Pottsville, Tonawanda, and Muncie. A majority of these teams are largely forgotten and the cities themselves too small in the present day to support a franchise with the exception of Green Bay.

One of the most interesting teams from this time period in my humble opinion were the Pottsville Maroons hailing from the small coal mining town in Eastern Pennsylvania.

I don't know if anyone else has highlighted them in here, but I want to give flowers to some defunct franchises who shaped the league that we know and love today.

Originally being founded in 1920 as an independent team, they joined the Anthracite League in 1924. This league was made up of 5 Eastern Pennsylvania coal mining towns. This league was short lived folding after only one season and the Maroons left for the NFL in 1925.

Few if any expected the newly joined franchise to be successful in their first season, but they surprised many with 10-2 which landed them 2nd place in league standings that year. Looking back at them 100 years later it seems like they fell just short of the Championship that year, but the truth is that the debacle that was the 1925 Championship controversy.

It all started when the Maroons beat the Chicago Cardinals on December 6th, 1925, at Comiskey Park in Chicago. This was no small feat as the Cardinals were the top team in the NFL that year and the frontrunners for the 1925 Championship at that point in the season. The following week they were scheduled to play the Notre Dame All-Stars featuring the legendary ""Four Horsemen"" and Knute Rockne at the helm.

The Frankford Yellow Jackets, who played out of Philadelphia, had secured the rights to play the Notre Dame squad, but once the Maroons pulled ahead of them in league standings the NFL granted them permission to take their place. Maroons' owner John Striegel had booked Shibe Field in Philadelphia for the two teams to play at due to its larger capacity than their home field, which was Minersville Park. This action infringed upon the Yellow Jacket's territory, and NFL commissioner Joe Carr warned the Maroons that they would be suspended if they proceeded with the game. Striegel, not wanting to lose the money that he had paid for to use the stadium went ahead anyways with the game and claimed that the NFL had given him permission to do so although. However, when asked about it years later gave differing details.

Fortunately for the Maroons, they beat Notre Dame 9-7 which was seen as a major win for the legitimacy of the NFL against one of the top teams in college football. On the flip side, Carr carried with his original threat and suspended the Maroons following the game.

In a strange twist of events, the Chicago Cardinals who then were #1 in league standings following the Maroons suspension fixed a game against the Milwaukee Badgers who used high school players to fill their roster which was illegal. With the Maroons now suspended, the NFL offered the Cardinals the Championship but, Cardinals owner Chris O'Brien declined on the grounds that the Maroons had beaten them earlier in the season and the NFL never officially awarded a winner for the 1925 season.

This is also where the Cardinals curse was born as the Bidwill family who took over the Cardinals in 1933 claimed the title as theirs and have since only won one NFL championship in 1947 and remain the oldest professional sports franchise to not have won a championship in the modern era. (Sorry Cardinals fans)

Ironically, the Maroons suspension was short lived as Joe Carr immediately reinstated them to avoid them joining the AFL in 1926. (Not the AFL that we know, there was actually three different AFL's this one was created by Red Grange's agent C.C. Pyle after contract negotiations fell through) They put up another strong outing in 1926 with a 10-2-2 record but it was only enough to finish 3rd in standings, and they were only able to muster a 7-16 record the following record in the 2 seasons that followed.

After the 1928 season John Striegel sold the Maroons to a Boston based company and the franchise folded for good after a 4-4 season. Interestingly enough, some claim that the Commanders are a continuation of the Maroons due to their similar colors and both franchises being based in Boston. Neither the NFL nor the Commanders recognize this connection, but it is still interesting, nonetheless.

Even though their time in the NFL was short they played a part in innovating the NFL as we know it. The Maroons were the first NFL franchise to play a night game to boost fan attendance to allow for coal miners and factory workers to attend games.

They also had 3 Hall of Famers play for their team who were Pete Henry, Walt Kiesling, and John ""Blood"" McNally. They also had arguably one of the most underrated players of the time in Tony Latone play for them for their whole franchise's history. Hailing from the small coal mining town of Edwardsville, Latone captured the tough, hard-nosed spirit that captured the 1920s to a tee. Not only did he have more rushing touchdowns and yards than Bears Hall of Famer Red Grange, but he is one of the few players to knock Grange out in a game and Grange himself is quoted as saying that he couldn't get paid enough to take a hit from Latone. Unfortunately for Latone, he was never named to an All-Pro team in his career due to the small market of Pottsville, but he got his flowers in 2021 when he was added to the Pro Football Research Association's Hall of Very Good.

Thank you to all who take the time to read this, and I hope that I can honor the Maroons at least to some degree. Feel free to comment other defunct franchises for me to spotlight in the future I am more than open to suggestions.

1l2n5gr,nfl,Defunct Team Spotlight: Providence Steam Roller,"Last week I took you guys to the small coal mining town in central Pennsylvania of Pottsville. Today we travel 300 miles northeast to the city of Providence, Rhode Island.

Originally founded in 1916 by three members of the *Providence Journal*, the team started out as a small semi-pro team and gradually gained prestige eventually gaining the title of best independent team in the nation by the early 1920s.

1924 was a truly a game-changing year as they played 5 NFL teams that season and beating 3 of them, the Minneapolis Marines, Rochester Jeffersons, and Dayton Triangles. This did not go unnoticed by the NFL who offered them a place in the NFL for the 1925 season. Playing at the Providence Cycledrome, (bicycle racing track) the Steam Rollers started their first few seasons in the NFL with mediocre records of 6-5-1 and 5-7-1 before making significant changes in 1927.

During the 1927 offseason, the steamrollers signed star QB and future Hall of Famer Jimmy Conzelman and ""Wildcat"" Wilson who had been an All-American at the University of Washington and had played for the Los Angeles Wildcats in the AFL the previous season. This marked the beginning of the turnaround for the franchise as they improved to 8 wins and finished 5th in league standings.

Starting off the 1928 season with a 20-7 rout of Red Grange and the New York Yankees (not the Yankees of baseball, there were a lot of NFL teams who copied M L B names in order to build fanbases in the early years of the NFL) the Steam Rollers finished with a season record of 8-1-2 which was enough for them to win the NFL Championship that year. Interestingly enough, the Frankford Yellow Jackets won more games than them that season, but the NFL decided to switch from most overall wins for a team to win percentage in order to determine a championship winner.

It's also funny that it was the Yellow Jackets who were on the wrong end of the stick for this change in rules if you remember what happened last week when I discussed the Maroons and the Yellow Jackets owner complaining about the Maroons violating their territory.

Following their victory, the city of Providence held a victory banquet in which each player received a gold watch for their efforts on the team. Jimmy Conzelman also received a trophy and named the teams ""Most Valuable Player"".

Unfortunately for the Steam Rollers, this was ultimately the height of their success as the downward spiral of the team began the following season. During the 1928 season, the Steam Rollers had had 5 players named to the All-Pro team, but 3 of those players left the team and the two others sustained injuries that kept them out of most of the season. Jimmy Conzelman was unable to fully recover from a knee injury the previous season and his performance was limited.

Funnily enough, one of the players who had left the Steam Rollers, Gus Sonnenberg who had been a bruising halfback left to pursue a career as a professional wrestler.  His rationale for this decision was based on the fact that he had become the world heavyweight champion and was receiving better pay than he had on the Steam Rollers. He was a three-time heavyweight wrestling champion and was inducted into the Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame in 2007.

The 1929 Steam Rollers were only able to put up a 4-6-2 record and after another two more below average seasons the owners of the Steam Rollers were forced to sell the team back to the NFL after the 1931 season due to financial shortcomings and the toll of the Great Depression.

Even though the team only lasted 7 seasons there were many NFL firsts that the Steam Rollers pioneered. The first of these was the first team to play at a bicycle racing stadium. They are also the only team to play 4 games in 6 days that proved to be disastrous for the team as they came out of the marathon with a 0-3-1 record. Due to heavy rain the previous day, the NFL hastily set up the first night game in league history when the Steam Rollers hosted the Chicago Cardinals on November 3, 1929, under the floodlights of Kinsley Park in Providence.

The name for the team comes from team co-owner, Charles Coppen hearing a fan saying that the other team was ""getting steamrolled"" and he loved it so much that he named the team that. Even though the team folded in 1931, a BAA (Basketball Association of America who later joined the N B A) had a franchise in 1946 under the name Providence Steam Rollers.

Over the course of their 7-year history, the Steam Rollers had two Hall of Famers play for them in the likes of Fritz Pollard who was the first African American player in NFL history and co-coach of the 1920 Akron Pros and Jimmy Conzelman who played/coached for them from 1927-1929. Conzelman is one of those forgotten early playmakers of the 1920s NFL, but he played a big part in the growth of the NFL.

Playing for the Decatur Staleys, Rock Island Independents, Milwaukee Badgers, Detroit Panthers, and Providence Steam Rollers over the course of his 10-year career. Jumping from team to team was common in the early days when contracts were for a set number of games instead of on a season-by-season basis like it is in modern times, but I think there is some commonality with a modern-day sports figure who had a similar career timeline as Conzelman. Even though Conzelman was a good QB and coach for the teams he was on, the talent around his was often sub-par at best and he didn't enjoy championship success until he joined the Steam Rollers in 1927.

The modern-day equivalent of Jimmy Conzelman is Kevin Durant of the N B A. I know this may seem very nuanced and odd but let me break down the similarities. Both men were known for their intelligent play, team hopping in search of championships and success, had off-the-field personas, and being criminally underrated for their respective time. Kevin Durant is the modern-day equivalent of what Jimmy Conzelman was to early football, an elite, intelligent players who were often under credited for their impact on their respective sports.

Luckily for Conzelman, he was elected to the Hall of Fame in 1964, to which he himself refused at first because he believed there were players more deserving than him. He was also named to the Arizona Cardinals Ring of Honor for his role as coaching their 1947 championship team.

Thank you again for taking the time to read this and feel free to comment which defunct team I should cover next!
